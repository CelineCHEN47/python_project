## generation model
in the generation part, implement the preprocessing.py first, it would save those dataset into the data folder. 
Then call train.py to implement training. The current code ignore all of the evaluation part to ensure it can run locally.
And i manually deleted the result folder generated by train.py to make sure those files can be pushed onto github.
