I like all my exmh stuff\nin nice columns (fits the display better).   That is, I use the detached\nfolder list, one column.   The main exmh window takes up full screen,\ntop to bottom, but less than half the width, etc...\n\nI have space for more sequences, in the ""unseen"" window, as long as they\nremain once nice narrow window (best would be if the sequences could be\nordered by some preference, then ones which didn\'t fit would just fall\noff the bottom, and not be shown).\n\nI\'d also prefer it if that window had no unusual background colouring,\njust one constant colour - I have been running the unseen window with\nbackground black, on a root window that is all black, with no borders or\nother decorations, but made ""sticky"" - the appearance is just like the\nfolders with unseen messages (and their counts) are written into the\nroot window (because it is sticky, this small display follows me around\nand do I can see when new mail needs processing).\n\nI also find that I tend to have a bunch of sequences that only ever occur\nin one folder (some I had forgotten I ever created).  So in addition to\nthe ""sequences to always show"" and ""sequences to never show"", a\npreference to only show sequences that occur in more than one folder\nwould be useful, and then have the sequences that occor only in the\nfolder I\'m visiting appear in the list when that folder is current.\nThis is just to keep the list size somewhat manageable while remaining\nproductive (I quite often use a sequence to remember a particular message\nin a folder - the name is used only there, and only for one message,\nit gives me a handle on the message which remains as the folder is\npacked, sorted, etc).\n\nI haven\'t updated my exmh for some time now, so I\'m not sure if this\nnext one is new, or just new since 2.5, but the Sequences menu (on the\nbar with New Flist Search ...) only contains ""unseen"" and ""urgent"".\nIt would be useful if it contained all of the sequences that the folder\nhappens to have defined.   A ""New sequence"" entry would also be useful\n(to mark the message with a sequence name that didn\'t previously exist,\nwhich can be done now using ""Search"" and the pick interface, but is\nclumsy that way)\n\nActually, you once could, now when I try this, entering a sequence name\nin the pick box, and a single message number, or a range N-N in the\nlist of messages, and no pick attributes at all, I now get ...\n\nsyntax error in expression ""int(1+1+(1 hit-1)*(3868-1-2)/(4878-1))""\n    while executing\n""expr int($minlineno+1+($msgid-$minmsgid)*($maxlineno-$minlineno-2)/($maxmsgid-$minmsgid))""\n    (procedure ""Ftoc_FindMsg"" line 46)\n    invoked from within\n""Ftoc_FindMsg $msg""\n    (procedure ""Ftoc_FindMsgs"" line 5)\n    invoked from within\n""Ftoc_FindMsgs $msgids""\n    (procedure ""Ftoc_PickMsgs"" line 5)\n    invoked from within\n""Ftoc_PickMsgs $pick(ids) $pick(addtosel)""\n    (procedure ""PickInner"" line 13)\n    invoked from within\n""PickInner {exec pick +inbox -list} {4852 -sequence mercury}""\n    (""uplevel"" body line 1)\n    invoked from within\n""uplevel #0 $cmd""\n    (procedure ""busyCursorInner"" line 8)\n    invoked from within\n""busyCursorInner $cmd $widgets""\n    (procedure ""busyCursorHack"" line 32)\n    invoked from within\n""busyCursorHack $args""\n    (""cursor"" arm line 1)\n    invoked from within\n""switch $busy(style) {\n\ticon\t\t{busyIcon $args}\n\tcursorAll\t{busyCursor $args}\n\tcursor\t\t{busyCursorHack $args}\n\tdefault\t\t{eval $args}\n    }""\n    (procedure ""busy"" line 3)\n    invoked from within\n""busy PickInner $cmd $msgs""\n    (procedure ""Pick_It"" line 51)\n    invoked from within\n""Pick_It""\n    invoked from within\n"".pick.but.pick invoke""\n    (""uplevel"" body line 1)\n    invoked from within\n""uplevel #0 [list $w invoke]""\n    (procedure ""tkButtonUp"" line 7)\n    invoked from within\n""tkButtonUp .pick.but.pick\n""\n    (command bound to event)\n\nIt has been ages since I did this last though.

That\'s a steppe too far\n (Filed: 28/08/2002) \n \n \n So you think you\'ve got it bad: fed up with Folkestone, bored with Birmingham\n or sick of Sheffield.\n \n Those 54 per cent of Britons - according to a Daily Telegraph/YouGov survey\n this week - who dream of a stress-free life in sunnier climes should perhaps\n heed a word of friendly advice on the realities of living abroad.\n \n Kommersant, a Russian daily newspaper, yesterday offered those dissatisfied\n with life in Blair\'s Britain a taste of what to expect should they choose to\n emigrate to provincial Russia.\n \n After reading about the gripes of affluent Britons, its tongue-in-cheek\n article admitted, however, that the grass was not always greener on the other\n side.\n \n ""The inhabitants of foggy Albion keen to travel could go to any Russian city\n deep in the provinces where things are quiet,"" said Kommersant.\n \n ""In any central Russian district, life, by British standards, is unseemingly\n cheap and remarkably laid back. By 11am most of the working population are\n becoming \'traditionally\' relaxed.""\n \n The time for elevenses in Britain - perhaps the opportunity for a quiet cup of\n tea and a chocolate Hobnob - is known in Russia as the Wolf Hour.\n \n It was so named in Soviet times because at 11am a wolf appeared from the\n famous animal clock at the Obrasov Puppet Theatre in Moscow. It is also\n opening time in the nation\'s vodka shops.\n \n And the vodka, like all other spirits, is cheap. Kommersant pointed out that\n ""the money a Briton can earn from selling even the most shabby house would be\n enough to support them at the local standard of living for the rest of their\n life.\n \n ""The local shops are full of all they would need and they could buy a bottle\n of whisky for kopecks.""\n \n There are 100 kopecks in a ruble and the ruble is currently worth about a\n halfpenny in sterling.\n \n The whisky is cheap, however, because it is unlike anything the average Briton\n will have consumed before. It is made of samagon - home-distilled, moonshine\n vodka - coloured with tea, and is a popular beverage in rural areas and among\n diehard alcoholics.\n \n While alcohol is plentiful and cheap, food may not be so easy to come by. The\n newspaper pointed out that traditional British foodstuffs - it selected oxtail\n soup as an example - were in short supply. However, the wealth of the British\n settler should overcome the difficulty.\n \n ""For a modest reward in most Russian villages, the locals would happily cut\n off the tails from the entire collective farm\'s herd of cattle.""\n \n One or two potential emigrés might be deterred by language difficulties. There\n are few English speakers to be found among the green hills of Tula on the\n Mongolian border.\n \n However, Kommersant pointed out, language difficulties were not considered a\n deterrent by the 13 per cent of Britons who nominated France as the country in\n which they would like to live.\n \n France, the Russian paper claimed, was a country ""where English is only known\n by the beggars, Belorussian prostitutes and Russian tourists"".\n \n Despite the low cost of living and the easy-going lifestyle, the Russian\n weather remains a major stumbling block for Britons.\n \n Even in the most temperate regions, winter temperatures of -20C are common.\n And somewhere like the Sakha Republic - east of Siberia and the coldest place\n in the world - enjoys just one month of summer and endures winter temperatures\n that drop below -70C. Houses are built on concrete stilts because the\n permafrost makes digging foundations impossible.\n \n Again, the Russian paper had a word of reassurance. While acknowledging the\n climatic problems, it said that ""thanks to global warming this difficulty will\n solve itself"".\n \n Kommersant also had an answer to the labour crisis that would be created in\n Britain if 54 per cent of its citizens decided to opt for a life in Russia.\n \n ""Thirty-three million Russians could be sent to Britain to replace the 33\n million who leave. We think that the required number could probably be found\n amongst our citizens.""\n \n Unfortunately for those 33 million Russians, however, not one of those Britons\n surveyed who wanted to move abroad nominated the Russian steppes as their\n preferred new home.\n\n\n------------------------ Yahoo!

I\'ll tone down\nthe rhetoric.\n\nQuoting Paul Linehan (plinehan@yahoo.com):\n\n> Indeed - that I actually had understood prior to all this - for\n> example commercial entities with trial/limited/crippled editions. \n> \n> Which is no problem - I don\'t see why that should be a problem for\n> SuSE though - surely the more the merrrier as far as they\'re\n> concerned.\n\nAnything either you or I have to say about their motivation is\nspeculation.  Bearing that disclaimer in mind, here\'s mine:  They make\nmoney from selling boxed sets.  They\'re glad to make some versions\navailable for almost-unrestricted distribution (not ""for value"") via CD\nduplication or the Internet that they estimate won\'t substitute for\nboxed-set sales.\n\nFor example, they _could_ have packaged what I call the ""FTP edition"" \nin ISO9660 images.  The fact that they didn\'t suggests to me that they\nsee the inconvenience of mirroring FTP Edition i386 files (which, at the\nmoment, are v. 8.0) as motivation for all but the really determined to\nbuy boxed sets, instead.  \n\nLikewise, they _could_ release a v. 8.0 (current) version of the\n""evaluation"" single-disk ISO image.  Instead, they always keep it\nseveral versions behind.  This again seems like an incentive to buy a\nboxed set, after ""evaluating"" SuSE via the ISO image.\n\nAgain, the above is my speculation (only) about their motivations.  All\nwe know of a certainty is what permissions they\'ve granted, which are a\nbit messy and complex, but nonetheless quite clear.\n\nThose permissions, as a reminder, apply to the SuSE-produced components,\nYaST, YaST2, the distribution installer program, and possibly other\nutilities that I don\'t know of.  _They_ wrote that code, and have every\nright to grant or withhold permissions as suit them best.\n\n> One can suspect what one likes. What I didn\'t understand was that SuSE\n> had proprietary extensions that it wasn\'t prepared to allow people to\n> use under the GPL or even under  a FreeBSD style licence.\n\nHmm, let\'s slow down, here:  There\'s a persistent misconception that\nit\'s possible to place somebody else\'s work under a new licence without\nhis permission.  Not so.  There is nothing in copyright law that would\nmake that possible.\n\nThe copyright _owner_ has inherent rights in his (e.g., software) work,\nand is entitled to issue as many _instances_ of his code under diverse\nlicences as he wishes.  (If he gives you a copy with no licence\nstatement, there\'s effectively a default licence by operation of\ncopyright law.  To avoid going into a long digression, let me just say\nthat it\'s a proprietary licence by default.  That\'s why, in order to\nhave open source software at all, there must be an explicit licence\nfrom the copyright holder.)\n\nNo Linux distribution _ever_ entails relicensing people\'s software\nwithout their explicit permission -- since no such relicensing can occur\nat all. \n \nYou cannot get away with taking SuSE Linux AG\'s work and redistributing\nit under what you claim to be a BSD licence, or the GPL, or anything at\nall other than what the copyright owner has specified, because you\nsimply lack the right to do so.  Claiming to do it would be copyright\nviolation.\n\n> I thought that the model for the likes of SuSE was selling support and\n> customisation, rather than what I thought of as the core ""product"". I\n> thought that the likes of Yast came under core - maybe it worked in\n> the glory days before, say, 2001 - I can understand that they might\n> want to make more money, but the way in which they have done it, seems\n> to me, to be be against the spirit of the GPL.\n\nIf Stallman and friends at the GPL (let alone Linus Torvalds and kernel\ncontributors) had intended to prohibit putting GPLed works on the same\nCDs as proprietary ones, and selling the result only via retail stores\n(plus mail order, etc.) in shrink-wrapped boxes, I\'m 100% certain they\ncould and would have done so.\n\nGuess what?  They did not.  They didn\'t even require that anybody give\nyou copies of the GPLed components, ever, at all.  All they did was\nrequire that _if_ you received GPLed software lawfully, then you had to \nbe able to get matching source code for a limited period, upon request.\n\nSpirit of the GPL, you say?  I\'d suggest that Stallman and company knew\nexactly what they were doing, and that the degree of access to GPLed\nsoftware is exactly what they had in mind.\n \n> All I want is the OS and GNU apps. I was under the impression that for\n> *_those_* all one needed was to pay for the media and not for the code\n> itself?\n> \n> Ai-je tort?\n\nMais si.\n\nYou are indeed under a misconception, and may want to read the text of\nthe GPL to verify this fact.  The GPL does _not_ entitle you to a copy\nof any binary software.  Section 2 provides for rights to access to\nmatching source code _if_ you have lawfully received a copy of a covered\nbinary.  That section provides three alternative mechanisms for the\ndistributor to provide such access.  And SuSE _do_ actually provide \nexactly that access.\n\nOr so I think to be the case.  If you believe there\'s some GPLed\ncodebase that you can lawfully receive from SuSE whose matching source\ncode they are not making available exactly as required, please tell us\nwhich codebase that is.  (That would be SuSE Linux AG\'s headache, not\nany of ours, but it might be interesting to examine.)\n\n> My understanding was that binaries or whatever could be received for\n> the cost of the media plus a token of one\'s appreciation (the latter\n> being subject to agreement between the parties) - I was offering a\n> bottle of wine plus maybe a pint or two and a chat for a copy - I\n> don\'t know what the going rate is.\n\nYour understanding is almost correct, but not quite.  (1) The access\nprovisions of the GPL concern access to _source code_, not binaries.\n(2) It kicks in _only_ for people who\'ve lawfully received covered\nbinaries.  (3) _Covered_ software means instances of codebases actually\nplaced under the GNU GPL by their copyright owners.  The mere act of \nplacing a piece of software on a CD-ROM with GPLed software doesn\'t GPL\nit.\n\nIn fact, the assertion to the contrary is a favourite FUD tactic from\nenemies of Linux:  They\'re forever trying to convince software producers\nthat using GPLed software in any way with their proprietary offerings\nwill ""taint"" their copyrights and force them to put their property under\nthe GPL.  It\'s simply not so.\n\n> If I wanted support from SuSE, that would be a different issue, and\n> one for which I would be willing to pay.\n\nThat\'s nice, but they\'re not _offering_ the exact contents of the boxed\nsets free of charge and lawful to duplicate & redistribute, or ""borrow"".\nFor one thing, as you will have noticed from my earlier listing of\ncomponents, the boxed sets\' CD-ROMs include quite a lot of _third-party_\nproprietary software.  SuSE Linux AG _cannot_ allow you (or your friend)\nto hand out copies of that software freely, because it\'s not theirs in\nthe first place.\n \n> I have a friend with 7.3 - I think that I\'ll end up doing that!\n\nIf you mean the 3-CD core set of RH 7.3, good.  It\'s a quite decent\ndistribution.  But bear in mind that the RH 7.3 boxed sets include\nsome other third-party applications whose owners would be very upset to\nfind them being copied or ""borrowed"". \n\n> I have now realised this, thanks to your kind explanations. I can\n> borrow them, but not copy them? \n\nNo.\n\nLook, it\'s a collection of software, many elements of which may not be\nlawfully just given out to multiple people:  Your friend installing it,\nthen _not_ erasing it but merely letting you ""borrow"" the CDs results in\nthe product being installed in multiple places.  That\'s unauthorised\ncopying.\n\n> And, as I\'ve tried to explain, is not the licence terms on, say,\n> trials for commercial company x to which I object, it is the way SuSE\n> appears, at least to my I.T. peasant self, to have mixed up\n> proprietary and open stuff.\n\nWell, if you don\'t like SuSE, then you probably won\'t like Caldera\neDesk, Xandros Desktop, Lycoris Deskop LX, Libranet, Lindows, or KRUD,\neither.  Depending on your criteria, you also might not like Red Hat,\nLinux-Mandrake, or Yellow Dog, since all of those have boxed-set retail\nsets that include CD-ROMs that may not be publicly redistributed.\n \n(I don\'t even use SuSE.

If you really want to run Razor\nindividually then you should set the \'score RAZOR_CHECK 0\' so that SA\nwon\'t do it and avoid the double network hit.\n\nHowever, one of the benefits of using SA in combination with Razor has\nbeen the history of false positive reports in the razor database.  The\ncurrent score of 3 is hefty, but not enough by itself to tag as spam.\nBut for any real spam is usually enough to push it over the threshold.\nRazor2 addresses the false positive problem but is not yet in as wide\nof use as Razor1.\n\nBob\n']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"is 10 .

His crime: writing code that exposed flaws in Adobe\'s\n         e-book security, in contravention of the USA\'s exciting new\n         DMCA. In the next year, thanks to widespread protests, Adobe\n         withdrew their call to prosecute the Russian hacker and\n         Dmitry was freed. Elcomsoft is still in the dock for\n         breaching Adobe\'s copy restriction routines. If the aim of\n         the prosecution was to cow them into keeping quiet about\n         security problems, it doesn\'t appear to have worked. On July\n         12th, 2002, ELCOMSOFT posted to Bugtraq a flaw in Adobe\'s\n         e-book security. Namely, that in Adobe\'s ""lending library""\n         web app for the Adobe Content Server, you can borrow a book\n         for over twenty years (instead of three days) just by\n         changing a hidden Web form value. The library site is just a\n         demonstration app, so it\'s not a serious problem, but it\n         does give Elcomsoft room for a catty little addendum. ""Some\n         time ago"", they write ""we have found much more serious\n         problem with another Adobe software and reported it to the\n         vendor; however, there was no response at all, and so we\n         decided not to waste our time reporting this one (about the\n         library) to Adobe"".

Just days before we\n         read on Slashdot that zombie company FORGENT is demanding\n         patent license fees for users of JPEG, we\'re contacted by\n         someone who has received a similiarly threatening letter -\n         this time, from the rather more established Lucent\n         Technologies. The message reads: ""After some market research\n         it has come to our attention that some of your company\'s\n         products may employ the JBIG/JPEG Standard. Therefore,\n         Lucent Technologies GRL LLC, Lucent\'s licensing agent, is\n         contacting your company regarding your interest in obtaining\n         a license for patents."" What follows is the usual demand for\n         fees, dire threats if compliance is thwarted, requests that\n         the guards seize the criminals and throw them in Patent\n         Dungeon, etc. Now, Lucent\'s patents don\'t seem to be\n         breached by a JPEG implementaton (although it\'s known that\n         JBIG is patent-encumbered; hence JBIG-2). So why does Lucent\n         bring up JPEG at all? A curious wording for sure, and we\'d\n         be interested to see if anyone else has been contacted in\n         these terms.

For example, audio recordings have such an\nexemption (dating from the early \'80s IIRC), which is why you can\'t\n(legally) be in the business of renting audio CDs; the creators can\ncontrol what you do with it after they\'ve sold it to you.

If they can\'t figure out how to make\nmoney doing something, they\'ll actually burn money to make sure no\n""industry outsider"" can either for all intents and purposes; control is\nmore important than maximizing profit as long as they can make a\nprofit.  They don\'t need your carrot, so they only engage in reasonable\nbusiness behavior when you are carrying a very large stick, and few\npeople swing a stick large enough.  They are being chronically\n""investigated"" by the DoJ for anti-trust, collusion, and similar\nactivities, but that is mostly just for show.\n\nWhich isn\'t to say that the entertainment industry won\'t fall victim to\nits own stupidity, but their ability to do arbitrary and capricious\nprice manipulation with impunity is going to make it a slow decline.\n\n-James Rogers\n jamesr@best.com\n\n\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Reply: Subject: Re: The GOv gets tough on Net Users - Reply Body

The first day\'s \nfindings at the hearings are really quite remarkable: \n\n    By contract, artists are prohibited from showing royalty statements to \n    third parties. Normally this would not include their mangers, lawyers, \n    consultants, or others who could aid them in getting paid, but apparently \n    this is not necessarily the case. Senator Kevin Murray, leading the \n    initiative for artists\' rights, claimed the that Cary Sherman, Chief \n    Counsel for the RIAA himself, said to him in an interview, that RIAA \n    members (the major labels) would sue any artist that broke ranks and shared \n    information with the Committee. This claim was rejected by Sherman but \n    supported by others in the room. Don Henley, among them, outwardly dared \n    his record company to sue him for bringing royalty statements to the \n    hearing. He presented his most recent royalty statement for ""Hell Freezes \n    Over,"" which showed the panel that even though his contract called for a no \n    more than a 10% ""reserve"" on sales of records shipped, Universal Music had \n    held back more than that for eleven pay periods (roughly under three years) \n    and that, even though his contract calls for no free goods in Europe, they \n    had deducted $87,000 in free goods charges to Europe.  \n\nLink[1] Discuss[2] (_Thanks, Paul!_)\n\n[1] http://www.musicdish.com/mag/?id=6675\n[2] http://www.quicktopic.com/boing/H/jU9jRkFhUcp\n\n\n']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"the Committee found it unreasonable to hold them in contempt of court and to order them to pay the cost of their

This -is- a First Amendment issue.\nPublic streets, provided one isn\'t blocking traffic, generally tend to\nbe sorta ok, at least from my last interpretation of Con Law a few\nyears ago (I\'ll feign ignorance wrt the fact that laws may have\nchanged, and the specific facts in this case are weak).

Lets assume a few things.\nIf I walk into the city office and tell them I want to peacably\nassemble against Bush, do you think they\'ll give me a permit?\nProbably not.   So I lie.   Then the cop does what happened in this\nscenario.  HE walks up, checks my permit and finds out that I\nfalsified my statement to get this said document.

Shouting\ndown has grown to become the answer because the government, over a\nspan of years, and with the help of the Courts -has- limited the\nrights we have as citizens under the First Amendment.    If you\nquestion the policy about terrorism, or drugs, or Iraq, or Bush in\ngeneral, you\'re aiding terrorism.   If you challenge the beliefs of\nthe folks attending the various shadowy G8 conferences, you\'re an\nanarchist, and you\'re herded off to a \'designated protest spot\' miles\naway from anything.   Part of the point of speech is to be -heard-.\nI can scream on my soapbox in the forest somewhere, and while thats\nspeech, its not effective speech.  People are screaming and shouting\nover the political figures because they cannot be  heard in any other\nway.\n\n\n\n\nGAB> I think that given the information as laid out by the story,\nGAB> Mr. O\'Neill has confused free speech with action.

Action involves directing\nGAB> a specific comment to a specific well-defined individual or audience\nGAB> that has immediate, harmful, and sometimes physical \nGAB> effects that is easily forseeable by any reasonable person. \n\nGetting back to my original point.  How do you communicate  an idea to\nan unknown audience, if you\'re miles from where the audience is?   How\ndo you bypass the rules for being -miles- away from the audience\nwithout violating the rules of the regime?  I don\'t think Mr. Nell was\nthrowing pies at Bush.

I have been, and I think\nmost people, respond with a 5.7.1 code, a ""permanent"" error. That\npretty much means, ""Don\'t bother to try from that address again,\nyou\'ll get the same error."" People often add cathartic messages to\naccompany the 550 like, ""Spammers must die.""\n\nBut this might not be the best way to go. You are telling the spammers\nthat you are on to them. This may cause them to try other methods to\nget around your blocks. Is it perhaps better to blackhole the mail?\nThat is, act like everything is OK during the SMTP transaction, but\nthen just drop the mail into the bitbucket. (This is generally how\nSpamAssassin works since almost everyone uses it after the SMTP\ntransaction has completed successfully.) Spammer thinks everything is\ngoing fine and has no reason to try new methods.\n\nThen there is a third possibility. Instead of returning a 550 code\nindicating you\'re on to the spammer, fake a 5.1.1 response which is\nsaying ""mailbox does not exist."" This would be in the hopes that some\nspammers out there actually remove names reported as non-existent from\ntheir lists. I know, a slim hope, but even if only a few do, it can\nlower the incidence.\n\nSo, what are the arguments for each? Do spammers even look at _any_ of\nthe bounce messages they get? The volume of bounces must be\nhuge. Personally, I\'m starting to think blackholes are the way to\ngo... But sending back that ""Spammer die, die, die,"" or stock ""Access\nDEE-NIED!""

Bronson -\n the serial hostage taker, not the movie star - has written a health and\n fitness guide in which he shares some of the secrets behind his legendary\n muscle power. \n \n Solitary Fitness - a title which bears testament to the fact that Bronson, 48,\n has spent 24 of his 28 prison years in solitary confinement - explains how he\n has turned himself into a lean, mean, fitness machine while living 23 hours a\n day in a space just 12 feet by eight feet, on a diet of scrubs grub and at\n virtually no cost. \n \n The book is aimed at those who want to get fabulously fit without spending a\n fortune on gym memberships, protein supplements or designer trainers, and\n starts with a fierce attack on some of the expensive myths churned out by the\n exercise industry. \n \n ""I pick up a fitness mag, I start to laugh and I wipe my arse with it,"" is the\n opening paragraph penned by Bronson. ""It\x92s a joke and a big con and they call\n me a criminal!"" You can\x92t help feeling he has a point. \n \n This is not the first book that Bronson has written from behind bars, having\n already published Birdman Opens His Mind, which features drawings and poems\n created by Bronson while in prison. And he is not the first prisoner to\n discover creative expression while residing at Her Majesty\x92s pleasure. \n \n Jimmy Boyle, the Scots sculptor and novelist, discovered his artistic talents\n when he was sent to Barlinnie Prison\x92s famous special unit, which aimed to\n help inmates put their violent pasts behind them by teaching them how to\n express their emotions artistically. Boyle was sentenced to life for the\n murder of ""Babs"" Rooney in 1967. Once released, he moved to Edinburgh where he\n has become a respected artist. His first novel, Hero of the Underworld, was\n published in 1999 and his autobiography, A Sense of Freedom, was made into an\n award-winning film. \n \n Hugh Collins was jailed for life in 1977 for the murder of William Mooney in\n Glasgow, and in his first year in Barlinnie prison stabbed three prison\n officers, earning him an extra seven-year sentence. But, after being\n transferred to the same unit that Boyle attended, he learned to sculpt and\n developed an interest in art. He later published Autobiography of a Murderer,\n a frank account of Glasgow\x92s criminal culture in the 1960s, which received\n critical praise. \n \n And Lord Archer doesn\x92t seem to have had trouble continuing to write the books\n that have made him millions while in jail. He recently signed a three-book\n deal with Macmillan publishers worth a reported £10 million, and is no doubt\n scribbling away as we speak. \n \n So why is it that men like Collins, Bronson and Boyle, who can be so\n destructive towards society on the outside, can become so creative once stuck\n on the inside? Steve Richards, Bronson\x92s publisher, has published many books\n about criminal figures and believes the roots of this phenomenon are both\n pragmatic and profound. \n \n He says: ""Prison is sometimes the first time some criminals will ever have\n known a stable environment, and this can be the first time they have the\n chance to focus on their creative skills. \n \n ""It may also be the first time that they have really had the chance of an\n education, if their early years have been hard. It could be the first time\n anyone has offered them the chance to explore their creative talents."" \n \n However, Richards believes the reasons are also deeper than that. He says:\n ""Once they are behind bars, the cold light of day hits them, and they examine\n the very essence of who they are. \n \n ""They ask themselves, am I a man who wants to be remembered for violence? Or\n am I a man who can contribute to society, who can be remembered for something\n good?"" \n \n Bronson - who was born Michael Gordon Peterson, but changed his name to that\n of the Hollywood star of the Death Wish films - has, so far, been remembered\n mainly for things bad. He was originally jailed for seven years for armed\n robbery in 1974, and has had a series of sentences added to his original term\n over the years as a result of attacking people in prison. In 2000 he was\n jailed for life after being convicted of holding a teacher hostage for nearly\n two days during a jail siege. \n \n Standing five feet ten and a half inches tall and weighing 210lbs, he is\n renowned for his strength. He has bent metal cell doors with his bare hands\n and does up to 3,000 - yes, 3,000 - press-ups a day. As he puts it: ""I can hit\n a man 20 times in four seconds, I can push 132 press ups in 60 seconds."" \n \n But judging by our current obsession with health and exercise, Solitary\n Fitness might be the book which will see Bronson\x92s face sitting on every\n coffee table in the land. He might be the man to give us the dream body which\n so many so-called fitness gurus promise but fail to motivate us into. Because\n Bronson has learned to use words as powerfully as he can use his fists. \n \n ""All this crap about high-protein drinks, pills, diets, it\x92s just a load of\n bollocks and a multi-million-pound racket,"" he writes, in what can only be\n described as a refreshingly honest style. ""We can all be fat lazy bastards,\n it\x92s our choice, I\x92m sick of hearing and reading about excuses, if you stuff\n your face with shit you become shit, that\x92s logical to me."" \n \n As motivational mantras go, that might be just the kick up the, er, backside\n we all needed. \n \n \n Solitary Fitness by Charles Bronson is published by Mirage Publishing and will\n be available in bookstores from October at £7.99\n\n\n------------------------ Yahoo!

Rohit]\n\nIn your article about Chinese attempts to censor Google last week (""The\nSearch Goes On"", Sept. 19th), the followup correctly noted that the most\nsubversive aspect of Google\'s service is not its card catalog, which\nmerely points surfers in the right direction, but the entire library. By\nmaintaining what amounts to a live backup of the entire World Wide Web,\nif you can get to Google\'s cache, you can read anything you\'d like.\n\nThe techniques Chinese Internet Service Providers are using to enforce\nthese rules, however, all depend on the fact that traffic to and from\nGoogle, or indeed almost all public websites, is unencrypted. Almost all\nWeb browsers, however, include support for Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)\nencryption for securing credit card numbers and the like. Upgrading to\nSSL makes it effectively impossible for a \'man-in-the-middle\' to meddle;\ncensorship would have to be imposed on each individual computer in\nChina. The only choice left is to either ban the entire site (range of\nIP addresses), but not the kind of selective filtering reported on in\nthe article.\n\nOf course, the additional computing power to encrypt all this traffic\ncosts real money. If the United States is so concerned about the free\nflow of information, why shouldn\'t the Broadcasting Board of Governors\nsponsor an encrypted interface to Google, or for that matter, the rest\nof the Web?\n\nTo date, public diplomacy efforts have focused on public-sector\nprogramming for the Voice of America, Radio Sawa, and the like. Just\nimagine if the US government got into the business of subsidizing secure\naccess to private-sector media instead. Nothing illustrates the freedom\nof the press as much as the wacky excess of the press itself -- and most\nof it is already salted away at Google and the Internet Archive project.\n\nOn second thought, I can hardly imagine this Administration *promoting*\nthe use of encryption to uphold privacy rights.

For the country\'s fast-growing population of\nInternet users (46m, according to an official estimate), it is proving\nan elusive creature. Earlier this month, the Chinese authorities blocked\naccess to Google from Internet service providers in China—apparently\nbecause the search engine helped Chinese users to get access to\nforbidden sites. Now, after an outcry from those users, access has been\nrestored.\n\nAn unusual climbdown by China\'s zealous Internet censors? Hardly. More\nsophisticated controls have now been imposed that make it difficult to\nuse Google to search for material deemed offensive to the government.\nAccess is still blocked to the cached versions of web pages taken by\nGoogle as it trawls the Internet. These once provided a handy way for\nChinese users to see material stored on blocked websites.\n\nAfter the blocking of Google on August 31st, many Chinese Internet users\nposted messages on bulletin boards in China protesting against the move.\nTheir anger was again aroused last week when some Chinese Internet\nproviders began rerouting users trying to reach the blocked Google site\nto far less powerful search engines in China.\n\nDuncan Clark, the head of a Beijing-based technology consultancy firm,\nBDA (China) Ltd, says China is trying a new tactic in its efforts to\ncensor the Internet. Until recently, it had focused on blocking\nindividual sites, including all pages stored on them. Now it seems to be\nfiltering data transmitted to or from foreign websites to search for key\nwords that might indicate undesirable content. For example earlier this\nweek when using Eastnet, a Beijing-based Internet provider, a search on\nGoogle for Falun Gong—a quasi-Buddhist exercise sect outlawed in China—\nusually aborted before all the results had time to appear.

Private money paid for these bits, but expropriation may be fairer for IP than real-P.\n\nRohit\n\nkhare@alumni.caltech.edu\n\n\nVast Detail on Towers\' Collapse May Be Sealed\n\nSeptember 30, 2002\nBy JAMES GLANZ and ERIC LIPTON \n\n\n\n\n \n\nWhat is almost certainly the most sophisticated and\ncomplete understanding of exactly how and why the twin\ntowers of the World Trade Center fell has been compiled as\npart of a largely secret proceeding in federal court in\nLower Manhattan. \n\nAmassed during the initial stages of a complicated\ninsurance lawsuit involving the trade center, the\nconfidential material contains data and expert analysis\ndeveloped by some of the nation\'s most respected\nengineering minds. It includes computer calculations that\nhave produced a series of three-dimensional images of the\ncrumpled insides of the towers after the planes hit,\nhelping to identify the sequence of failures that led to\nthe collapses. \n\nAn immense body of documentary evidence, like maps of the\ndebris piles, rare photos and videos, has also been\naccumulated in a collection that far outstrips what\ngovernment analysts have been able to put together as they\nstruggle to answer the scientifically complex and\nemotionally charged questions surrounding the deadly\nfailures of the buildings. \n\nBut everyone from structural engineers to relatives of\nvictims fear that the closely held information, which\nincludes the analysis and the possible answers that\nfamilies and engineers around the world have craved, may\nremain buried in sealed files, or even destroyed. \n\nBound by confidentiality agreements with their clients, the\nexperts cannot disclose their findings publicly as they\nwait for the case to play out. Such restrictions are\ntypical during the discovery phase of litigation. And as it\nnow stands, the judge in the case - who has agreed that\ncertain material can remain secret for the time being - has\napproved standard legal arrangements that, should the\nlawsuit be settled before trial, could cause crucial\nmaterial generated by the competing sides to be withheld. \n\n""We\'re obviously in favor of releasing the information, but\nwe can\'t until we\'re told what to do,"" said Matthys Levy,\nan engineer and founding partner at Weidlinger Associates,\nwho is a consultant in the case and the author of ""Why\nBuildings Fall Down: How Structures Fail"" (Norton, 2nd\nedition, 2002). \n\n""Let\'s just say we understand the mechanics of the whole\nprocess"" of the collapse, Mr. Levy said. \n\nMonica Gabrielle, who lost her husband, Richard, when the\nsouth tower fell and who is a member of the Skyscraper\nSafety Campaign, said the information should be disclosed.\n""If they have answers and are not going to share them, I\nwould be devastated,"" Mrs. Gabrielle said. ""They have a\nmoral obligation."" \n\nThe lawsuit that has generated the information involves\nLarry A. Silverstein, whose companies own a lease on the\ntrade center property, and a consortium of insurance\ncompanies. Mr. Silverstein maintains that each jetliner\nthat hit the towers constituted a separate terrorist\nattack, entitling him to some $7 billion, rather than half\nthat amount, as the insurance companies say. \n\nAs both sides have prepared their arguments, they have\nspent hundreds of thousands of dollars acquiring expert\nopinion about exactly what happened to the towers. \n\nDean Davison, a spokesman for Industrial Risk Insurers of\nHartford, one of the insurance companies in the suit, said\nof the findings, ""There are some confidentiality agreements\nthat are keeping those out of the public domain today."" He\nconceded that differing opinions among the more than 20\ninsurers on his side of the case could complicate any\nrelease of the material. \n\nAs for his own company, whose consultants alone have\nproduced more than 1,700 pages of analysis and thousands of\ndiagrams and photographs, Mr. Davison said every attempt\nwould be made to give the material eventually to ""public\nauthorities and investigative teams."" \n\nStill, some of that analysis relies on information like\nblueprints and building records from other sources, like\nthe Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which built\nand owned the trade center and supports Mr. Silverstein in\nthe suit. Mr. Davison said he was uncertain how the\ndiffering origins of the material would influence his\ncompany\'s ability to release information. \n\nIn a statement, the Port Authority said access to documents\nwould be ""decided on a case-by-case basis consistent with\napplicable law and policy,"" adding that it would cooperate\nwith ""federal investigations."" \n\nThe fate of the research is particularly critical to\nresolve unanswered questions about why the towers fell,\ngiven the dissatisfaction with the first major inquiry into\nthe buildings\' collapse. That investigation, led by the\nFederal Emergency Management Agency, was plagued by few\nresources, a lack of access to crucial information like\nbuilding plans, and infighting among experts and officials.\nA new federal investigation intended to remedy those\nfailings has just begun at the National Institute of\nStandards and Technology, or NIST, an agency that has\nstudied many building disasters. \n\nOfficials with NIST have said it could take years to make\nfinal determinations and recommendations for other\nbuildings, a process they now acknowledge might be speeded\nup with access to the analysis done by the consultants on\nthe lawsuit. \n\nGerald McKelvey, a spokesman for Mr. Silverstein, said of\nthe real estate executive\'s own heavily financed\ninvestigative work, ""We decline to comment other than to\nsay that Silverstein is cooperating fully with the NIST\ninvestigation."" A spokesman for the agency confirmed it was\nin discussions with Mr. Silverstein on the material, but\nsaid no transfer had taken place. \n\nWith no shortage of money or expertise, investigations by\nboth sides in the legal case have produced a startling body\nof science and theory, some of it relevant not only to the\ntrade center disaster but to other skyscrapers as well. \n\n""The work should be available to other investigators,"" said\nRamon Gilsanz, a structural engineer and managing partner\nat Gilsanz Murray Steficek, who was a member of the earlier\ninquiry. ""It could be used to build better buildings in the\nfuture."" \n\nLegal experts say confidentiality arrangements like the one\ngoverning the material can lead to a variety of outcomes,\nfrom full or partial disclosure to destruction of such\ninformation. In some cases, litigants who paid for the\nreports may make them public themselves. Or they may ask to\nhave them sealed forever. \n""It is not unusual for one party or another to try to keep\nsome of those documents secret for one reason or another,\nsome legitimate, some not,"" said Lee Levine, a First\nAmendment lawyer at Levine Sullivan & Koch in Washington. \n\nMr. Levine said that because of the presumed value of the\ninformation, the court might look favorably on requests to\nmake it public. But the uncertainty over the fate of the\nmaterial is unnerving to many people, especially experts\nwho believe that only a complete review of the evidence -\nnot piecemeal disclosures by litigants eager to protect\ntheir own interests - could lead to an advance in the\nfederal investigation of the trade center. \n\n""It\'s important for this to get presented and published and\nsubjected to some scrutiny,"" said Dr. John Osteraas,\ndirector of civil engineering practice at Exponent Failure\nAnalysis in Menlo Park, Calif., and a consultant on the\ncase, ""because then the general engineering community can\nsort it out."" \n\nThe scope of the investigation behind the scenes is vast by\nany measure. Mr. Levy and his colleagues at Weidlinger\nAssociates, hired by Silverstein Properties, have called\nupon powerful computer programs, originally developed with\nthe Pentagon for classified research, to create a model of\nthe Sept. 11 attack from beginning to end. \n\nThe result is a compilation of three-dimensional images of\nthe severed exterior columns, smashed floor and damaged\ncore of the towers, beginning with the impacts and\nproceeding up to the moments of collapse. Those images -\nwhich Mr. Levy is not allowed to release - have helped\npinpoint the structural failures. \n\nThe FEMA investigators did not have access to such computer\nmodeling. Nor did the FEMA team have unfettered access to\nthe trade center site, with all its evidence, in the weeks\nimmediately after the attacks. But no such constraints\nhampered engineers at LZA/Thornton-Tomasetti, brought to\nthe site for emergency work beginning on the afternoon of\nSept. 11. Daniel A. Cuoco, the company president and a\nconsultant to Silverstein Properties on the case, said he\nhad assembled detailed maps of the blazing debris at ground\nzero in models that perhaps contain further clues about how\nthe towers fell. \n\nThough the FEMA team could not determine ""where things\nactually fell,"" Mr. Cuoco said, ""we\'ve indicated the\nspecific locations."" \n\nMr. Cuoco said he could not reveal any additional details\nof the findings. Nor would Mr. Osteraas discuss the details\nof computer calculations his company has done on the spread\nof fires in large buildings like the twin towers. Mr.\nOsteraas has also compiled an extensive archive of\nphotographs and videos of the towers that day, some of\nwhich he believes have not been available to other\ninvestigators. \n\nAnd the investigation has not limited itself to computers\nand documentary evidence. For months, experiments in wind\ntunnels in the United States and Canada have been examining\nthe aerodynamics that fed the flames that day and stressed\nthe weakening structures. \n\nJack Cermak, president of Cermak Peterka Peterson in Fort\nCollins, Colo., was retained by the insurance companies but\nhad previously performed wind-tunn']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"irm

At shopping \nmalls, on factory floors, at church socials and even on our front \nstoops, we will be approached by individuals who want to represent us in \npublic office. While chances are high that we won't know them \npersonally, they will walk up to us, offer a handshake and a flier and \nask for our votes.\n\nJust as technology is affecting every other area of communication, it \nhas begun to affect the way political candidates communicate with voters.\n\nIn this year's GOP gubernatorial primary, California Secretary of State \nBill Jones, who faced better-funded candidates, acquired the e-mail \naddresses of more than a million potential California voters and sent \neach an unsolicited e-mail asking for support.\n\nThat day, he might have chosen any of the more traditional -- and more \nexpensive -- methods of contacting voters, such as direct mail, radio \nspots or TV ads. But he spent only about 2 cents per message, instead of \n35 cents or more per message for direct mail or in another medium.\n\nHad Jones chosen direct mail, radio or TV, that communication would have \nbeen equally ``unsolicited,'' as defined in the e-mail world. Few voters \nwould have ``opted in'' to receive campaign information from Jones \nthrough any of those channels.\n\nThe response to Jones' e-mail effort, however, was swift and intense. He \nwas lambasted by anti-spam advocates, and media coverage was almost \nentirely negative. To be fair, some of Jones' tactics could have been \nrefined. He used a less-than-perfect list and no standard-practice \n``paid for'' disclaimer in the message.\n\nHis detractors, however, attacked him not for his tactical miscues but \nbecause the e-mail was sent unsolicited. In fact, Jones' online campaign \nmay have been his most visible asset. In an era of cynicism toward money \nin politics -- money typically spent on other unsolicited communication \nmediums -- Jones tried to level the playing field.\n\nNo one likes commercial spam. It is irrelevant and untargeted and can be \nhighly intrusive and even offensive. But as a sophisticated society, \nit's time to differentiate commercial spam from very different \nunsolicited e-mail sent by political candidates to voters.\n\nThe debate is particularly relevant in light of legislation in Congress \nthat would constitute the first federal law to directly address spam. We \nbelieve e-mail is no more intrusive than direct mail, telemarketing or \nTV advertising when it comes to politicians seeking to reach voters. A \nsimple link in good e-mail campaigns allows recipients to opt out of \nfuture mailings. Direct mail takes at least a phone call or stamp to be \ntaken off a list, and viewers must repeatedly endure TV ads.\n\nWhen a candidate lacks a large campaign war chest, he or she can use the \nInternet to provide constituents with information to better prepare them \nto perform their civic duty of casting educated votes. With more than 60 \npercent of all potential voters in this country possessing e-mail \naccounts, it makes sense that political candidates use this medium.\n\nCandidates might avoid some of the tactical problems encountered by the \nJones campaign if they use the technologies available today that better \nensure quality of e-mail lists and target content to specific recipient \ngroups.\n\nBut the broader point remains. When a political candidate sends a voter \nan e-mail, that recipient can choose to delete the message without \nopening it, unsubscribe from the list, read it or even reply and engage \nthe sender. That choice should belong to the voter -- not to anti-spam \nadvocates whose efforts are better focused on commercial e-mail. \nPolitical candidates should be free to communicate with voters as best \nthey can, and let voters decide what to do with that information.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMike McCurry, former press secretary for President Clinton, is CEO of an \nadvocacy management and communications software company.

0,"['Subject: Re: [ILUG] Interesting article on free software licences  \n\n\nI have translated the article in full - see \nend of post (I think that I\'ve done a far \nbetter job than the Google translation - at \nleast it\'s readable now - any corrections\nappreciated).\n\nStuff in {}\'s is my (and others) additions \nto the debate.\n\nMy apologies if I\'ve paraphrased anybody \nincorrectly, I will be glad to retract if \nanyone is miffed.\n\n\n\nThe article makes four main points.\n\n\n1) Absence of critical clauses. \n\n\nIn this case, the idea is that the licence \nis invalid because it doesn\'t specify\nunder what country\'s law the GPL is governed.\n\n\n2) Specification in English only.\n\nThat for the end user (as opposed to businesses), \nthe GPL doesn\'t apply because it\'s not written \nin French.\n\n\n3) Arbitary licence change.\n\nThe point here is that (under French law) the \nauthor can change the terms of the licence \narbitarily. This is because any granting of \nrights by an author must be clearly delimited\nin terms of how long, where, to whom, dates and \ntimes. In the absence of such limitations, the \noriginal author has the right to change his \nsoftware back to closed on a whim.\n\n\n{\n\nDavid Neary makes the point that the copyright \nholder automatically retains the right to change \nthe licence.\n\nScott replies it simply requires authorisation from \nall *copyright holders*\n\nThat\'s not my understanding. French law allows a \nGPL type licence *_on condition_* that the \nspecific conditions of the granting of such\nrights are clear - if they are not, there is\nnothing to stop the original author taking\nback ""his work"". The lawyers see this\n(correctly IMHO) as a weakness in the GPL).\n\n}\n\n\n\n4) Hidden defects.\n\nRoughly, this clause means that the author(s) \nis/are liable for any defects if the consumer \nis not an IT engineer, so if Linux blows up \nand data is lost, then the authors are liable.\n\n\n{\n\nCiaran Johnson says that M$oft and others have \nsimilar clauses - the point here is that they \nare *_all_* invalid - just that this one \naffects the GPL also.\n\nNiall O\'Broinn makes the point that it is not\na sale, but rather a service/leasing arrangement\nand that\'s why it doesn\'t come under this point.\n\nI would suggest that the whole thrust of this\narticle has been to see software ""sales"" (even\nif no money changes hands) as governed very\nmuch by consumer law (in France anyway).\n\n\nRick Moen makes the point that it is not\na sale but rather a granting of rights which\nare not default. \n\nSee the bit about even the granting of \nrights by an author having to be \nexplicitly specified - under French law.\n\n\nThe fact that two IP lawyers in France think that\nthe GPL is covered as a sale make me feel that \nthere is a de facto sale and a de facto contract.\n\n}\n\n\n\n5) Roughly.\n\nThere may be other reasons under French \nlaw why the  GPL may be invalid.\n\n\n\n-----  Whole Article. -----------\n\n\nFreedom(a) is worth more than these \nimperfect licences.\n\n\nSpecialised lawyers look at the GPL.\n\n\n\nLawyer Cyril Rojinsky (duly appointed to \nthe court) and the jurist Vincent Grynbaum, both \nspecialised in the area of intellectual property \nexamine the ""free"" licences and in particular the \nGPL. They have published their study\nin the review ""Proprietes intellectuelles \n(Intellectual property)[1]"" and their\nconclusion is grim.\n\n\nTheir approach is interesting. The problem for \nthem is not to know whether freedom is valid under \nFrench law (for them the question is a moot point)\nbut rather they asked themselves about the form \nand the content of the text of free licences, and \nin particular the GPL. The problem is not free \nprogrammes, but rather the licence contracts of \nfree programmes.\n\n\n\nAbsence of critical clauses.\n\n\n\nThe authors tell us that first of all, the \nreference to ""copyright"" is not legally \nsufficient in the framework of international \ncontracts  (which is the case of licence \ncontracts for programmes developed and spread \nvia the Internet). The idea of copyright can \nbasically include differences from one country \nto another. This is why, under international \ncontracts, it is necessary to specify to which \nlaws one is referring (French law, American &c.).\n\nThe authors only found three public licences \nwhich were correctly formulated on this point: \nQPL, IBM Public Licence and the Mozilla Public\nLicence).\n\n\n\nSpecification in the English language.\n\n\n\nNext, the authors remind us that (at least in \nFrance), no clause in a contract may be contrary \nto French law [2]. However, it turns out that a \nlicence such as the GPL is contrary to French law \nin several respects. Firstly, it is written in \nEnglish and the FSF doesn\'t officially approve \ntranslations. \n\nThe ""Toubon law"" obliges this sort \nof contract to be written in French, including for \nbusinesses since the notion of ""user"" applies not \nonly to consumers, but also to businesses, \nprofessionals &c. \n\n\nContacted by the editors of LinuxFrench, \nlawyer Cyril Rojinsky declared that, as \nfar as business is concerned, the ""Toubon \nlaw"" is probably doomed to change since \nit is in contradiction of European directives \non the subject, but whatever about that, the \nproblem is still valid for individuals, and \nwhile waiting for it (French law) to change, \nFrench companies have to deal with it, since \nit is the law of the land.\n\n\nA programme under the GPL can suddenly \nchange licence.\n\n\nAnother problem, much more serious, is \nthat according to French law, the author of \na free programme can, at any time, invoke \nthe invalidity of the licence for this \nsoftware by simply changing the licence.\n\n\nIn effect, the law of intellectual \nproperty stipulates that the granting of  \nrights by the author is subordinate to \nthe condition that each of these granted \nrights be the object of a distinct clause \nin the granting act (i.e. the licence) and \nthat the granting of any such rights be \ndelimited with respect to its scope and its \ngrantees, and also with respect to its \nlocation (i.e. where such rights may be \nexcersised)  and duration of any such grants. \n[3] This is not the case of the GPL nor of\nother free licences. Briefly, this means \nthat in France, or elsewhere if the author \nis French, that which is under the GPL could \nrevert to proprietary from one day to the next. \n \n\n\nThe problem of the guarantee ""hidden defects"".\n\n\nAn other very serious flaw is that of the \nguarantee. The GPL licences and others show \nthat the software is delivered ""without \nguarantee"". You are going to immediately\nreply that commercical programmes carry the \nsame clause in their licence contracts,\nand this is correct. However, whatever is \nwritten in a licence contract, one cannot\nfree oneself from the ""guarantee from \nhidden defects"", since it is imposed in the \nCivil Code. This concept is poorly understood \nby the layman, it protects the buyer\n(whoever it may be, individual or business, \nsince it specifies the Civil Code and not \nconsumer protection law) against hidden \ndefects, deliberate or made in good faith by \nthe seller. \n\n\nFor example, if one buys a pair of socks \nin a sale, and the shop has a notice \nspecifying that ""Sale items are neither \nrefunded nor exchanged"", and on arriving \nhome you notice that one of the socks has \na hole in it, several scenarios are possible.\n\n\nYou could have checked the socks before \npurchase: the flaw is deemed ""obvious"" and\nyou can sing for your money.\n\n\nYou couldn\'t check the socks (they were \npackaged for example), and in this case, \ndespite the notice ""neither refund nor \nexchange"", you may invoke ""hidden defect"" \nand have them changed or obtain a refund, \nit\'s up to you. \n\nPersonally, I have already invoked in shops \nthe ""hidden defect"" clause and it always \nworked well (shopkeepers are always very \ncooperative if you quote a couple of words \nof the Civil Code). \n\n\nThe concept of hidden defect is rather \nwide, it is necessary that you hadn\'t \nthe possibility of discovering the defect \nbefore buying the product and then \n(according to the Civil Code) that you \nwouldn\'t have bought it at that price if \nyou had known about the\ndefect.\n\n\nThe third case which is much rarer , is \nif you are able to show that the vendor had\nknowledge of the defect (hidden), but didn\'t \ninform you. In this case, not only does he \nhave to reimburse the product, but all \nexpenses incurred by the sale (metro \ntickets to go to the shop, the fuse \nwhich blew when you plugged it in &c.)\n\n\nThis idea of ""hidden defect"" applies to\n all products, including programmes. This \nwas made abundantly clear by the \nauthorities (and the courts) surrounding \nY2K. \n\nThis is particularly inconvenient for \nfree programmes, since a site which \noffers a Linux distro for download is \nsupposed to provide a guarantee against \nhidden flaws.\n\n\nLinuxFrench asked Cyril ROJINSKY if \nin the case of a free programme, \none could speak about a ""hidden"" defect \nsince the source code was available, \nhe replied ""Actually, concerning the \nguarantee, the question of obvious \ndefect will arise. This analyis will \nbe different depending on whether the \nperson who downloads the distribution \nis an IT professional or not"". \n\nOpenSource has this advantage over \nthe proprietary programme: it protects \nthe distributor against a guarantee of\nhidden defect insofar as the buy is an \nIT person. But, for distribution to the \npublic at large, the problem remains \nthe same.\n\n\n\nRoughly Speaking.\n\n\nLawyer Cyril ROJINSKY said it himself, \nthis study is far from being exhaustive \nand many other areas could be explored. \n\nDuring this interview, we asked ourselves, \nfor example, about the fragility of the \nGPL clause which forbids linking source \ncode under the GPL with proprietary code. \n\nIn effect, the laws of intellectual \nproperty give the right to the user \nto modify a programme with the\nintention of permitting interoperability \nwith another programme. If for that,\nI need to link with a proprietary library \n(communication protocol, device driver)\nI may consider as ""null and void"" this \nclause of the GPL.\n\n\nT']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"\n3) Limitations on license terms. \n\n\n4) License for commercial purposes only.\n\n\n5) Limitation on licensing terms and conditions. \n\n

Could It?\n10)  Subscription Information\n\n\n\nTHE ISO17799 TOOLKIT UNCOVERED\n===============\n\nThe ISO17799 standard can be acquired either stand alone or as part of\nan introductory pack appropriately called \'The ISO17799 Toolkit\'. But\nwhy was it packaged thus, and what is included in the pack?  \n\nThe purpose of the toolkit is to help organizations get off to a flying\nstart with respect to ISO17799... not only to understand the standard\nitself but to begin to address many of the standard\'s requirements more\nquickly.\n\nThe contents can be broken down into two groups: those that help the\norganization to understand where ISO17799 fits and what is involved in\nembracing it, and those that help an organization to take the first\ncritical steps to compliance.\n\nIn the former group are the \'RoadMap to Certification\' (which broadly\ndescribes the process of gaining certification), the \'XL Management\nPresentation\' (which explains the history, background and current status\nof the standard) and of course the ISO17799 standard itself (both\nparts).\n\nIn the latter group are some key items to aid compliance. These include\na comprehensive set of ISO17799 compliant security policies to address\nsection 3 (Security Policy) and business continuity audit checklists to\nhelp address section 11 (Business Continuity Management).\n\nIt doesn\'t end there, however. For the audit section there is a detailed\nset of audit questionnaires to address various issues and platforms. For\nnewcomers to information security there is even a substantial glossary\nof terms.  \n\nClearly, creating such a toolkit was a significant undertaking. However,\nin terms of helping organizations exploring the initial stages of\nISO17799, it can be invaluable. \n\nMore information on the ISO17799 Toolkit and how to purchase can be\nfound at: http://www.iso17799-made-easy.com\n\nThe standard itself can alternatively be procured from:  \nhttp://www.iso17799.net \n\n\n\nSOCIAL ENGINEERING - ARE YOU SUSCEPTIBLE?\n====================\nThe term \'social engineering\' can conjure up a variety of ideas, usually\nbased around the concept of genetic tampering. However, when applied to\nIT security, it has its own implications and its own vocabulary.\n\nFollowing interviews with known computer criminals, a list of approaches\nhas been produced. These are designed to gather information without the\ntarget even realizing that they have parted with it.\n\nThe attempts are often made on an opportune bases, with common locations\nfor this sort of activity being planes, trains and pubs. The telephone\nis probably the major source of pre-meditated acts.  \n\nThe following are some of the major techniques employed:\n\nBAITING\nThis essentially involves asking a variety of questions, including some\nleading questions designed to \'catch\' the right answers. Often, items of\nconversation are introduced based upon replies received. The fiction is\nlegitimized with small amounts of fact in the right places.\n\nPULLING RANK\nThis amounts ot the perpetrator assuming a more senior position in the\ncompany than the victim and is usually enacted on the telephone. It does\nnot necessitate direct impersonation... only the POSITION needs to be\nassumed. \n\nEXHAUSTING\nThis involves asking a constant stream of similar questions to wear down\nthe target.\n\nSURF BOARDING\nBasically this is looking over someone\'s shoulder at something\nconfidential. This could be directly, through a window, through a\ndoorway, etc.\n\nSURVEYS\nThe information given freely in surveys can often be extremely useful to\na criminal. The surveys can initially be for entirely legitimate\npurposes, or can be completely bogus from the start. In either case\nsensitive information can often be obtained and unwittingly disclosed.\n\n\nThere are of course many other techniques. However, disclosure can be\nprevented via the use of a series of common sense rules and policies. \n\nBefore releasing any information it is essential to at least establish:\n\na) the sensitivity of the information\nb) your authority to exchange or release the information\nc) the real identity of the third party (proper authentication)\nd) the purpose of the exchange\n\nThe act of exchange should also be recorded for audit purposes.\n\n\n\nISO17799 - A WORLD WIDE PHENOMINA ================\nDisney would have said ""it\'s a small world after all"", but the global\ntake on of ISO17799 proves that organizations the planet over are\nembracing it with enthusiasm.\n\nTo illustrate the global nature of the standard, we recently created a\ntable from the last 500 purchases of the standard from the ISO17799\nElectronic Shop (www.iso17799.net). The figures below do come with a\nserious health warning though - the Electronic Shop is a credit card\npurchase system. Some cultures are not as comfortable or familiar as\nothers with credit card purchase and will therefore have their purchase\nposition significantly understated. An example is India, which acquires\nsubstantial numbers of the standard, only two of which show in the last\n500 from the download location.\n\nThat aside, the table makes interesting reading:\n\nArgentina 1 \nAustralia 6 \nAustria 5  \nBarbados 2 \nBelgium 5 \nBermuda 1 \nBosnia and Herzegovina 1 \nBrasil 2 \nBrazil 4 \nCanada 52 \nCayman Islands 1 \nChile 3 \nChina 3 \nColombia 5 \nCosta Rica 1 \nCroatia 1\nCyprus 1 \nDenmark 5 \nDeutschland 5  \nEgypt 4 \nEngland 26 \nFrance 3 \nGermany 20 \nGreece 3 \nGuatemala 1 \nHong Kong 7 \nHungary 1 \nIndia 2 \nIndonesia 2 \nIreland 11 \nIsle of Man 1 \nIsrael 1 \nItalia 1 \nItaly 20 \nJapan 3 \nMalaysia 5 \nMexico 9\nNetherlands 3 \nNew Zealand 2 \nNorthern Ireland 1 \nNorway 10 \nNZ 1 \nPanama 1 \nPortugal 1\nRussia 3 \nSacramento 1 \nScotland 3 \nSingapore 9\nSlovak Republic 1\nSlovenia 1\nSouth Africa 4\nSpain 9 \nSultanate of Oman 1 \nSweden 3 \nSwitzerland 14 \nTaiwan 3 \nThailand 2 \nThe Netherlands 8\nTunisia 1 \nTurkey 1 \nU.A.E 1 \nUK 51 \nUnited Arab Emirates 2 \nUnited Kingdom 24 \nUnited States 13 \nUnited States of America 25 \nUSA 176 \nVenezuela 2 \n\n\nSTRANGER DANGER\n=======\nAs you read this article, look around at your working environment. The\nitems/information you have to hand may not seem very sensitive because\nyou deal with them every day... but now look again.\n\nIf you were alone and not a member of staff, how would you view them?\nWhat would you find if you looked around? Picture yourself as a visitor\npassing through. What can you hear in terms of conversation? What can\nyou see?\n\nThe chances are that you can hear and see quite a lot that you would not\nwant to be openly disclosed to the outside world. If this is the case,\nthe security of your information is at risk potentially from every\nvisitor, stranger, subcontractor, etc. \n\nThis article is not written with the intention of discrediting visitors,\nbut nonetheless, it is important to be fully AWARE of what CAN happen if\ndue caution is not exercised.\n\nThe following guidelines may help in ensuring that the risks are\nminimized:\n\n* Your reception/visitor area should issue distinctive badges and ensure\nthat visitors wear them\n\n* Consider using different colored badges for each day of the week.\n\n* Challenge those who are not displaying any identity badges\n\n* If your location issues identity badges - make sure YOU wear yours\n\n* Do not be afraid to ask someone who they are visiting and what they\nare doing\n\n* Do not be lazy... escort visitors from reception (if applicable)...\ndon\'t let them make their way to you\n\n* Do not hold doors open for people not displaying their ID\n\n* Do not leave visitors alone   \n\n\n\nISO17799 - MORE FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\n=====================\n\n1) How many controls are there in the standard?\nPart 1 is organized into 10 sections. There are 127 main controls and\nover 500 detailed controls in total.\n\n2) What is part 2?\nPart 2 basically explains how to apply the standard itself, and how to\nbuild and operate an information security management system.\n\n3) How old is it?\nThe standard stems from an original publication in 1993, from the DTI in\nthe UK. It became BS7799 in 1995 and of course ISO17799 in 2000.\n\n4) What is accreditation?\nAn accreditation body can authorize others to ""certify"" third parties\nunder the standard (p2). A number of accreditation bodies exist in\ndifferent countries.\n\n5) Is certification for life?\nNo. It is normally for three year periods.\n\n6) ISO17799 is used throughout the world, but was it internationally\ncreated? Yes indeed. The latest versions included input from\nrepresentatives from many nations, including Australia, Brazil, Germany,\nNorway, UK and USA, amongst others.\n\n7) Is it linked to a specific national legal system?\nNo. It is generic in terms of legislation.\n\n\n\nCREDIT CARD TRANSACTIONS: MINIMIZE THE RISKS\n======================\n\nThe use of credit and debit cards to purchase goods and services has\nbecome an everyday convenience that we take for granted, but there are\nassociated information security risks which we should pause to consider,\nespecially when making payments over the Internet.  \n\nWeb sites are becoming an increasingly popular means of purchasing goods\nand services, but they have also become popular targets for cyber\nc']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"n10)  ISO17799: The Next Steps\n11)

Push never came to\nshove (at least, not yet :-) ) but my understanding of the situation vis a\nvis software is that in the absence of any contract granting ownership of\nthe code to another party, it remains with the person who wrote it. I didn't\ntake legal advice on this but my customer did :-) and his lawyer told him\nthat I was right and would most likely win in court.\n\nSo much for the ownership of the code vis a vis you and your client - now for\nthe GPL issues. \n\nCode compiled by a compiler which is GPL software (e.g. gcc) is not itself\ncovered by the GPL unless its author chooses to make it so. This is perhaps\nnot made clear enough in the GPL text and is a particular piece of FUD which\nMicrosoft loves to toss about. Similarly, the copy of PHP which is part of\nyour customer's system is covered by the GPL. You can charge him whatever\nyou like for it but you must provide him with acces to the source code, and\nyou cannot restrict what he can do with it (in this case, move it to another\nservice provider). However, you have not (I take it) chosen to license YOUR\ncode under the GPL so the conditions of the GPL do NOT apply to it.\n\nIf OTOH you had written some code which modified PHP as such, and then\ndistributed (whether for a fee or not) that modified PHP, then the modified\ncode must be licensed under the GPL. But this applies to a modification to\nPHP itself and NOT to your scripts which run under PHP.\n\nThe relevant clause is 2(b) which says (though Lord knows why I'm quoting when\nlocate COPYING will turn up a shedload of copies of the GPL on just about\nany Linux box - 540 on this box)\n\nb) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or\nin part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be\nlicensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of\nthis License.\n\n\nYour PHP scripts do not contain, nor are they derived from, PHP, in whole or\nin part.\n\n> I know this is not strictly a 'Linux' issue but any help would be appreciated\n\nMicrosoft has very much made this a Linux issue - it has attempted to imply\nthat any company using GPL software must make everything it owns public and\nit must be true - that nice man from Microsoft wouldn't lie, would he ?\n\n\n\nNiall\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"it is your responsibility to protect the intellectual property rights.

Groups Sponsor ---------------------~-->\n4 DVDs Free +s&p Join Now\nhttp://us.click.yahoo.com/pt6YBB/NXiEAA/Ey.GAA/26EolB/TM\n---------------------------------------------------------------------~->\n\nA new version of unison is now available for testing.  It incorporates\nseveral small improvements over 2.9.1, but the main change is a fix to\na bug that had potentially serious safety consequences, but only for\nthe very small number of users that are in the habit of running more\nthan one instance of Unison at a time, in parallel.  These users are\nstrongly encouraged to upgrade.  Others can wait if they wish.\n\nThe release includes pre-built executables for Linux and Solaris, but\nnot Windows.  (We are looking for a Unison-Windows maintainer -- at\nthe moment, none of the active developers are regularly using Unison\non Windows, and we do not have a machine that is configured properly\nfor building executables for export.)\n\nGrab it from here:\n   http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/download.html\n\nEnjoy,\n\n        -- Benjamin\n\n   Changes since 2.9.1:\n     * Added a preference maxthreads that can be used to limit the number\n       of simultaneous file transfers.\n     * Added a backupdir preference, which controls where backup files\n       are stored.\n     * Basic support added for OSX. In particular, Unison now recognizes\n       when one of the hosts being synchronized is running OSX and\n       switches to a case-insensitive treatment of filenames (i.e., 'foo'\n       and 'FOO' are considered to be the same file).

Unlike the\n       earlier attempt, this time we do not rely on the native thread\n       library of OCaml. Instead, we implement a light-weight,\n       non-preemptive multi-thread library in OCaml directly. This\n       version appears stable.\n       Some adjustments to unison are made to accommodate the\n       multi-threaded version. These include, in particular, changes to\n       the user interface and logging, for example:\n          + Two log entries for each transferring task, one for the\n            beginning, one for the end.\n          + Suppressed warning messages against removing temp files left\n            by a previous unison run, because warning does not work\n            nicely under multi-threading. The temp file names are made\n            less likely to coincide with the name of a file created by\n            the user. They take the form\n            .#<filename>.<serial>.unison.tmp.\n     * Added a new command to the GTK user interface: pressing 'f' causes\n       Unison to start a new update detection phase, using as paths just\n       those paths that have been detected as changed and not yet marked\n       as successfully completed. Use this command to quickly restart\n       Unison on just the set of paths still needing attention after a\n       previous run.\n     * Made the ignorecase preference user-visible, and changed the\n       initialization code so that it can be manually set to true, even\n       if neither host is running Windows. (This may be useful, e.g.,\n       when using Unison running on a Unix system with a FAT volume\n       mounted.)\n     * Small improvements and bug fixes:\n          + Errors in preference files now generate fatal errors rather\n            than warnings at startup time. (I.e., you can't go on from\n            them.) Also, we fixed a bug that was preventing these\n            warnings from appearing in the text UI, so some users who\n            have been running (unsuspectingly) with garbage in their\n            prefs files may now get error reports.\n          + Error reporting for preference files now provides file name\n            and line number.\n          + More intelligible message in the case of identical change to\n            the same files: ``Nothing to do: replicas have been changed\n            only in identical ways since last sync.''\n          + Files with prefix '.#' excluded when scanning for preference\n            files.\n          + Rsync instructions are send directly instead of first\n            marshaled.\n          + Won't try forever to get the fingerprint of a continuously\n            changing file: unison will give up after certain number of\n            retries.\n          + Other bug fixes, including the one reported by Peter Selinger\n            (force=older preference not working).\n     * Compilation:\n          + Upgraded to the new OCaml 3.04 compiler, with the LablGtk\n            1.2.3 library (patched version used for compiling under\n            Windows).\n          + Added the option to compile unison on the Windows platform\n            with Cygwin GNU C compiler.

It was one of the\nworst disasters in American naval history; only 317 of its nearly 1,200\ncrew members survived.\n\nNow experts at Southwest Texas State University have given that tragic\nstory a startling new twist.\n\nIt was the moon, they say, that sank the Indianapolis. Or anyway, they\nwrite in the July issue of Sky & Telescope, it was the moon that made\nthe sinking possible.\n\nUsing astronomical computer programs, records and weather reports, as\nwell as the known coordinates and running speeds of the ship and the\nsubmarine that sank it, the authors determined that when the I-58\nsurfaced, it was perfectly aligned, west to east, with the cruiser. And,\nthey said, a three-quarter moon had just emerged from behind the clouds.\n\nLooking across the moonlit water, an I-58 crewman spotted the ship\nsilhouetted against the sky, 10.3 miles away. Half an hour later, six\ntorpedoes sent it to the bottom.\n\n""It was sheer chance,"" said Dr. Donald Olson, an astronomer. ""Without\nthat alignment with the moon, the lookouts would not have spotted the\ncruiser, especially at that distance.""\n\nWith Russell Doescher, a physics lecturer, Dr. Olson conducts a\nuniversity honors course called ""Astronomy in Art, History and\nLiterature."" In the last 15 years, he has pinpointed the time and place\nof the rendering of art masterpieces, given new interpretations of\nastronomical references in Chaucer and revealed the decisive role of the\nmoon in military and other encounters.\n\nTwo years ago, for example, Dr. Olson turned his attention to the bright\nstar in van Gogh\'s ""White House at Night."" He and some students went to\nAuvers, France, where van Gogh created his final works, and searched\nuntil they found the house, largely unchanged. Sifting through letters\nfrom van Gogh to his brother, Dr. Olson found that the painting was\ncompleted in June 1890.\n\nNoting the orientation of the house in the painting, he determined where\nvan Gogh had set his easel and what section of the sky he had portrayed,\nand from the lighting and shadows, he established that the house had\nbeen illuminated by the setting sun. His computer analysis then\nidentified the ""star."" It was Venus, which in early evening in mid-June\nhad occupied that part of the sky.\n\nA final check of local weather records pinpointed the actual date van\nGogh had composed the painting, June 16, the only clear day in the\nmiddle of the month that year.\n\nDr. Olson has also turned his attention to Shakespeare, intrigued by the\nopening of ""Hamlet,"" when guards on the ramparts of Elsinor refer to the\n""star that\'s westward from the pole had made his course to illume that\npart of heaven where now it burns."" From the guards\' description, the\nseason and the time, other astronomers had suggested several bright\nstars as possibilities, but Dr. Olson\'s calculations placed it in the\nconstellation Cassiopeia, which lacks any notably luminous stars.\n\nPondering this problem on a trip with his wife, Dr. Olson was suddenly\ninspired. He was aware that in 1572, a supernova, called Tycho\'s star,\nfor the Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe, suddenly flamed in Cassiopeia,\ncreating a worldwide sensation. Shakespeare, 8 at the time, would\ncertainly have recalled the event, and his memory was probably refreshed\nby the description of the supernova in a history book that was the\nsource of some of his best-known plays.\n\nDr. Olson has no doubt that the star that glared above Elsinor that\nnight was Tycho\'s, and he has an impressive record of other\nastronomy-based sleuthing.\n\nAware that the photographer Ansel Adams often neglected to date his\nnegatives, Dr. Olson set out to find when Adams had shot his classic\n""Moon and Half Dome."" At Yosemite, Dr. Olson and his students found\nAdams\'s vantage point, studied the location, phase and features of the\nmoon in the photograph, plus the shadows on the Dome, snow on the peak\nand other clues, and then announced that the picture had been taken at\n4:14 p.m., Dec. 28, 1960.\n\nThen, Dr. Olson calculated that the setting would be virtually identical\nat 4:05 p.m. on Dec. 13, 1994. On that day Adams\'s daughter-in-law\nvisited Yosemite and was photographed holding a print of ""Moon and the\nHalf Dome"" in the foreground of an eerily similar view of the actual\nmoon and the Half Dome.\n\nAnalyzing Chaucer\'s works, Dr. Olson has confirmed that a particularly\nrapid movement of the moon described in ""The Merchant\'s Tale"" occurred\nin April 1389. And in ""The Franklin\'s Tale,"" Chaucer\'s description of\nthe heavenly alignment that caused an exceptionally high tide on the\nBrittany coast, convinced Dr. Olson that Chaucer was an advanced amateur\nastronomer.\n\nThen there was Paul Revere. On his way to saddle up for his famous ride,\nhow did he manage to row undetected past a British warship on a moonlit\nnight in Boston Harbor? Dr. Olson\'s computer program revealed that,\nwhile the moon was nearly full that night, it was unusually close to the\nsouthern horizon and did not illuminate Revere\'s boat.\n\nDr. Olson\'s proudest achievement was explaining ""the tide that failed""\nin the bloody Marine Corps landing at Tarawa atoll on Nov. 20, 1943.\nPlanners had expected a tide to provide a water depth of five feet over\na reef some 600 yards from shore, allowing larger landing craft, with\ndrafts of at least four feet, to pass.\n\nBut that day and the next, in the words of some observers, ""the ocean\njust sat there,"" providing neither low tide nor high tide and leaving a\nmean depth of three feet over the reef. The craft grounded on the edge\nof the reef, and many marines were killed or injured as they waded 600\nyards to the shore, rifles over their heads, in the face of machine-gun\nfire from the Japanese.\n\nAsked by a former marine about the tidal phenomenon, Dr. Olson spent six\nmonths researching and mastering tidal theory and discovered that the\nmilitary planners were aware that they had to contend with a ""neap""\ntide. This phenomenon occurs twice a month when the moon is near its\nfirst or last quarter, because the countering tug of the sun causes\nwater levels to deviate less.\n\nBut that day, the moon was also almost at its farthest point from earth\nand exerted even less pull, leaving the waters relatively undisturbed\nand the marines in trouble.\n\n""I\'m not in the least blaming the planners,"" Dr. Olson said, explaining\nthat the techniques used in accurately determining tides hadn\'t been\napplied to the waters at Tarawa.\n\nIndeed, he modestly claims, by using his computer program, ""We can\ncalculate the tides in any port in the world on any day in history.""\n\nYet Dr. Olson\'s greatest satisfaction seems to stem from his\ninterdisciplinary approach to astronomical sleuthing. ""I have thought\nabout van Gogh, about Shakespeare and Chaucer,"" he says, ""and that has\nmade my life as a scientist much richer.""\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n\n']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"the news and it\nwas the moon that brought light into the world\nOn its way back from the Pacific island of Tinian\ n

Programs such as mozilla and various others use these\nfunctions. An attacker could exploit this to remotely run arbitrary\ncode or crash an application by using a specially crafted png image.\n\nThese new releases also solve other minor bugs such as some memory\nleaks in reading image functions.\n\nSince most applications which display images use libpng, this affects\nmany applications including Evolution and Mozilla. Additionally, Red\nCarpet links libpng statically and needs to be updated separately.\n\nXimian only ships libpng on Solaris, and so we only have Solaris\npackages available.

He told me that he wanted to try and use\n<http://www.lindows.com/lindows_products_lindowsos.php> LindowsOS to\nwrite a story, but he didn\'t think it was possible because his office\nused Microsoft Word .doc files.

I selected ""Save as Microsoft Word.""\n\nThe reporter was not only surprised, he was amazed. Like many reporters,\nhe was under the impression that Linux was only for servers. The simple\nword processor demonstration went a long way to show him otherwise. For\nLinux to become a driving force in desktop computing it will have to\novercome a couple of myths. \n\nThe first myth is that Linux is too hard to install and configure. That\nmay have been true in the past, but we\'ve annihilated this myth with the\nlatest version of LindowsOS --which installs on most machines in under 5\nminutes. It\'s point- and-shoot easy - easier than any other operating\nsystem (Microsoft products included). See for yourself at <http://www.tryoutlinux.com/> .  \n\nThe other myth is that Linux is just for the server and none of the\ngraphical programs --which desktop users have come to rely on-- exist.\nNot only have many of the Linux software programs made quantum leaps\nover the last couple of years, but they\'ve gotten quite good at reading\nand writing Microsoft formats. The easiest way to experience these\nproducts is via the Click-N-Run  <http://www.lindows.com/warehouse>\nWarehouse.\n\n Here\'s a quick list of some of the quality programs available today in\nthe Warehouse <http://www.lindows.com/warehouse> all downloaded and\ninstalled with a single click:\n\nOpenOffice - This one installation will equip a computer with an\nimpressive collection of productivity programs each of which will open\nthe corresponding Microsoft file format and allow you to edit files and\nswap them with Microsoft counterparts. <www.lindows.com/openoffice>\nPrograms included are:\n\nOpenOffice Writer - Word processor (reads Microsoft Word docs) \nOpenOffice Calc - Spreadsheet (reads Microsoft Excel) \nOpenOffice Impress- Presentation package (reads Microsoft PowerPoint)\nOpenOffice Draw - A vector based drawing program\n\nClick here <http://www.lindows.com/openofficeflash>  for a great\ntutorial on getting to know OpenOffice.\n\nGIMP <www.lindows.com/gimp> If you are familiar with Adobe\'s Photoshop,\nyou\'ll want to Click-N-Run GIMP.

Just for the record - \nthe average salary for\na university graduate (including advanced degree holders) here is C$ \n21,000  -- < $14,000 US. No wonder\nhalf of San Francisco has set up here - we have a whole whack of call \ncenters that\nhave arrived here in the last couple of years - I think they hire some \nentry level IT people for around $10 ($6 US) an\nhour, which of course, fits perfectly for me - my entry level job, in \n1986, paid $11.00 an hour. The fundamental difference\nis that most of the jobs that require a trade are *unionized*.In other \nwords, in this part of the world, for the vast majority of people, \n union dues are a better investment than tuition. The counter-argument \nto this is that many college graduates\n leave for better work elsewhere, but the counter-counter argument is \nthat we are the thin edge\n(one of several really - prison labor in the US would be another) of \nthird-world wages and work practices coming\n to North America.\n\nI worked at a company that had a 14-year wage freeze. The fact that they \ncould maintain that (and prosper) just says\n volumes about the economy in this part of the world. I met many people \nthere, like me, who felt that was fine, I can vote\nwith my feet. They didn\'t quite realize that just about every large \nemployer in the area has similar, or worse, policies. Anyway\neventually they started a union drive. During the vote, retired \nemployees were brought in by the employer (rumours were\nthat they were paid the going rate for a vote around here - a bottle of \nrum) and somehow allowed to vote . The union filed\n a grievance - which was denied - by a Minister of Labour, who, hey, \nguess what - used to be a VP at the company.\nThat\'s free labor markets at work. The business continues to prosper - \nas I was told when I was there -  it is a cash cow as long\nas the JOA (Joint Operating Agreement) with the competing paper is in \nplace.\n\nAnd if you think that any of those wonderful American companies, out of \nsome free-enterprise belief in competing for the best talent,\nare going to do anything about that, sorry, most of them received \ngenerous subsidies, in return, I\'m sure, for an understanding about\nthe labor markets here.\n\n>\n>BTW, if we ever actually *had* free markets in this country,\n>*including* the abolition of redistributive income and death taxes,\n>all those smart people in the Forbes 400 would have *more* money, and\n>there would be *more* self-made people on that list.

Col. Michael Humm, a Pentagon spokesman, said the incident happened\nWednesday and that the North American Aerospace Defense Command in Colorado\nSprings, Colo., was continuing to investigate. \n\nThe reported contrail stirred concern because of the possibility that it\ncould have indicated the presence of an unauthorized jet aircraft in or\napproaching American airspace. In the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks, the\nPentagon has taken greater precautions to monitor U.S. airspace. \n\nA contrail is created by vapor from a jet engine in the presence of cold\nair. \n\nThe jets that were scrambled to attempt to intercept and identify the source\nof the contrail found nothing, said Lt. Cmdr. Curtis Jenkins, a NORAD\nspokesman. He said NORAD had developed no new information since the initial\nreport at 4 p.m. EST on Wednesday. NORAD is reviewing data from its tracking\nradars in search of evidence, he said. \n\nA Pentagon statement said NORAD received unverified reports of ``what\nappeared to be a contrail of unknown origin,\'\' originally in the vicinity of\nthe Turks and Caicos Islands in the Caribbean. \n\n``Initially, it was reported to be heading northwestward toward the United\nStates,\'\' the statement said. ``Commercial airline pilots later reported the\ncontrail over Florida and later over Indiana. Thereafter, no other sightings\nwere reported.\'\' \n\nThe reported contrail was never verified by visual or radar contact, the\nPentagon statement said. \n\nAt the Federal Aviation Administration, spokesman Paul Turk said, ``I\'m\naware of the reports.\'\' He referred all questions to NORAD. \n\nJenkins said he was not sure who reported the initial sighting over the\nCaribbean. He also was unsure who requested NORAD to launch fighter jets or\nfrom which military bases they were scrambled. \n\n``We don\'t necessarily judge or second-guess when a request comes to us to\ninvestigate\'\' a contrail, he said. \n\nMeanwhile, reports of a ball of fire streaking across the sky early Thursday\nhad people throughout the Northwest flooding radio and television stations\nwith calls reporting a meteor shower. \n\nIt was believed that the light came from a Russian rocket body re-entering\nthe Earth\'s atmosphere about 6:15 a.m. The U.S. Strategic Command in Omaha,\nNeb., and the North American Aerospace Defense Command confirmed a Russian\nrocket fell back to Earth, but gave no further details. \n\n\nAP-NY-11-28-02 1833EST\n\nCopyright 2002, The Associated Press.

This feeling seems especially intense in the Bush\nAdministration, perhaps because Bill Clinton has been bracketed by a\nfather-son team. It\'s easy for people in the Administration to believe\nthat, after an unfortunate eight-year interlude, the Bush family has\nresumed its governance-and about time, too.\n\nThe Bush Administration\'s sense that the Clinton years were a waste, or\nworse, is strongest in the realms of foreign policy and military affairs.\nRepublicans tend to regard Democrats as untrustworthy in defense and\nforeign policy, anyway, in ways that coincide with what people think of as\nClinton\'s weak points: an eagerness to please, a lack of discipline.\nCondoleezza Rice, Bush\'s national-security adviser, wrote an article in\nForeign Affairs two years ago in which she contemptuously accused Clinton\nof ""an extraordinary neglect of the fiduciary responsibilities of the\ncommander in chief."" Most of the top figures in foreign affairs in this\nAdministration also served under the President\'s father. They took office\nlast year, after what they regard as eight years of small-time flyswatting\nby Clinton, thinking that they were picking up where they\'d left off.\n\nNot long ago, I had lunch with-sorry!-a senior Administration\nforeign-policy official, at a restaurant in Washington called the Oval\nRoom. Early in the lunch, he handed me a twenty-seven- page report, whose\ncover bore the seal of the Department of Defense, an outline map of the\nworld, and these words:\n\nDefense Strategy for the 1990s:\nThe Regional Defense Strategy\nSecretary of Defense\nDick Cheney\nJanuary 1993\n\nOne of the difficulties of working at the highest level of government is\ncommunicating its drama. Actors, professional athletes, and even elected\npoliticians train for years, go through a great winnowing, and then perform\npublicly. People who have titles like Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense\nare just as ambitious and competitive, have worked just as long and hard,\nand are often playing for even higher stakes-but what they do all day is go\nto meetings and write memos and prepare briefings. How, possibly, to\nexplain that some of the documents, including the report that the senior\nofficial handed me, which was physically indistinguishable from a\nhigh-school term paper, represent the government version of playing\nCarnegie Hall?\n\nAfter the fall of the Berlin Wall, Dick Cheney, then the Secretary of\nDefense, set up a ""shop,"" as they say, to think about American foreign\npolicy after the Cold War, at the grand strategic level. The project, whose\nexistence was kept quiet, included people who are now back in the game, at\na higher level: among them, Paul Wolfowitz, the Deputy Secretary of\nDefense; Lewis Libby, Cheney\'s chief of staff; and Eric Edelman, a senior\nforeign-policy adviser to Cheney-generally speaking, a cohesive group of\nconservatives who regard themselves as bigger-thinking, tougher-minded, and\nintellectually bolder than most other people in Washington. (Donald\nRumsfeld, the Secretary of Defense, shares these characteristics, and has\nbeen closely associated with Cheney for more than thirty years.) Colin\nPowell, then the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, mounted a\ncompeting, and presumably more ideologically moderate, effort to reimagine\nAmerican foreign policy and defense. A date was set-May 21, 1990-on which\neach team would brief Cheney for an hour; Cheney would then brief President\nBush, after which Bush would make a foreign-policy address unveiling the\nnew grand strategy.\n\nEverybody worked for months on the ""five-twenty-one brief,"" with a sense\nthat the shape of the post-Cold War world was at stake. When Wolfowitz and\nPowell arrived at Cheney\'s office on May 21st, Wolfowitz went first, but\nhis briefing lasted far beyond the allotted hour, and Cheney (a hawk who,\nperhaps, liked what he was hearing) did not call time on him. Powell didn\'t\nget to present his alternate version of the future of the United States in\nthe world until a couple of weeks later. Cheney briefed President Bush,\nusing material mostly from Wolfowitz, and Bush prepared his major\nforeign-policy address. But he delivered it on August 2, 1990, the day that\nIraq invaded Kuwait, so nobody noticed.\n\nThe team kept working. In 1992, the Times got its hands on a version of the\nmaterial, and published a front-page story saying that the Pentagon\nenvisioned a future in which the United States could, and should, prevent\nany other nation or alliance from becoming a great power. A few weeks of\ncontroversy ensued about the Bush Administration\'s hawks being\n""unilateral""-controversy that Cheney\'s people put an end to with denials\nand the counter-leak of an edited, softer version of the same material.\n\nAs it became apparent that Bush was going to lose to Clinton, the Cheney\nteam\'s efforts took on the quality of a parting shot. The report that the\nsenior official handed me at lunch had been issued only a few days before\nClinton took office. It is a somewhat bland, opaque document-a ""scrubbed,""\nmeaning unclassified, version of something more candid-but it contained the\nessential ideas of ""shaping,"" rather than reacting to, the rest of the\nworld, and of preventing the rise of other superpowers. Its tone is one of\nskepticism about diplomatic partnerships. A more forthright version of the\nsame ideas can be found in a short book titled ""From Containment to Global\nLeadership?,"" which Zalmay Khalilzad, who joined Cheney\'s team in 1991 and\nis now special envoy to Afghanistan, published a couple of years into the\nClinton Administration, when he was out of government. It recommends that\nthe United States ""preclude the rise of another global rival for the\nindefinite future."" Khalilzad writes, ""It is a vital U.S. interest to\npreclude such a development-i.e., to be willing to use force if necessary\nfor the purpose.""\n\nWhen George W. Bush was campaigning for President, he and the people around\nhim didn\'t seem to be proposing a great doctrinal shift, along the lines of\nthe policy of containment of the Soviet Union\'s sphere of influence which\nthe United States maintained during the Cold War. In his first major\nforeign-policy speech, delivered in November of 1999, Bush declared that ""a\nPresident must be a clear-eyed realist,"" a formulation that seems to\nconnote an absence of world-remaking ambition. ""Realism"" is exactly the\nforeign-policy doctrine that Cheney\'s Pentagon team rejected, partly\nbecause it posits the impossibility of any one country\'s ever dominating\nworld affairs for any length of time.\n\nOne gets many reminders in Washington these days of how much the terrorist\nattacks of September 11th have changed official foreign-policy thinking.\nAny chief executive, of either party, would probably have done what Bush\nhas done so far-made war on the Taliban and Al Qaeda and enhanced domestic\nsecurity. It is only now, six months after the attacks, that we are truly\nentering the realm of Presidential choice, and all indications are that\nBush is going to use September 11th as the occasion to launch a new,\naggressive American foreign policy that would represent a broad change in\ndirection rather than a specific war on terrorism. All his rhetoric,\nespecially in the two addresses he has given to joint sessions of Congress\nsince September 11th, and all the information about his state of mind which\nhis aides have leaked, indicate that he sees this as the nation\'s moment of\ndestiny-a perception that the people around him seem to be encouraging,\nbecause it enhances Bush\'s stature and opens the way to more assertive\npolicymaking.\n\nInside government, the reason September 11th appears to have been ""a\ntransformative moment,"" as the senior official I had lunch with put it, is\nnot so much that it revealed the existence of a threat of which officials\nhad previously been unaware as that it drastically reduced the American\npublic\'s usual resistance to American military involvement overseas, at\nleast for a while. The Clinton Administration, beginning with the ""Black\nHawk Down"" operation in Mogadishu, during its first year, operated on the\nconviction that Americans were highly averse to casualties; the all-bombing\nKosovo operation, in Clinton\'s next-to-last year, was the ideal foreign\nmilitary adventure. Now that the United States has been attacked, the\noptions are much broader. The senior official approvingly mentioned a 1999\nstudy of casualty aversion by the Triangle Institute for Security Studies,\nwhich argued that the ""mass public"" is much less casualty-averse than the\nmilitary or the civilian élite believes; for example, the study showed that\nthe public would tolerate thirty thousand deaths in a military operation to\nprevent Iraq from acquiring weapons of mass destruction. (The American\ndeath total in the Vietnam War was about fifty-eight thousand.) September\n11th presumably reduced casualty aversion even further.\n\nRecently, I went to the White House to interview Condoleezza Rice. Rice\'s\nForeign Affairs article from 2000 begins with this declaration: ""The United\nStates has found it exceedingly difficult to define its \'national interest\'\nin the absence of Soviet power."" I asked her whether that is still the\ncase. ""I think the difficulty has passed in defining a role,"" she said\nimmediately. ""I think September 11th was one of those great earthquakes\nthat clarify and sharpen. Events are in much sharper relief."" Like Bush,\nshe said that opposing terrorism and preventing the accumulation of weapons\nof mass destruction ""in the hands of irresponsible states"" now define the\nnational interest. (The latter goal, by the way, is new-in Bush\'s sp']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"affairs.

That was the day my company, IDT, one of the world\'s largest Internet and alternative telecommunications providers, went public. As IDT\'s founder, president, and majority shareholder, I was instantly rich beyond my wildest dreams. People ask me if this was the greatest moment in my business life. It wasn\'t.\n\nFour months later, on July 18, 1996, we released a new technology, a breakthrough that would eventually cut the cost of international calls by a remarkable 95 percent. That day Sara Grosvenor, the great-granddaughter of Alexander Graham Bell, joined us in New York to use our new technology in order to place the first phone call ever over the network to Susan Cheever, the great-granddaughter of Thomas Watson, in London.\n\nWithin twenty-four hours of Ms. Grosvenor saying ""Come here, Ms. Watson, I need to see you"" over our system, CNN, CNBC, and newspapers had spread word of the development to investors and potential users and partners around the world. Combined with a more than fivefold increase in our quarterly revenues for the second year in a row, IDT\'s stock price started to move upward again. Many people who saw me glowing that morning asked if this was the greatest moment of my business life. It wasn\'t.\n\nThe greatest moment actually occurred approximately twenty-seven years earlier on the morning of July 23, 1970. That was the morning I pushed my newly built hot dog stand past Joe and Vinny\'s butcher shop on Eastchester Road in the Bronx. Only two months before, Joe had driven me from my after-school job in the butcher shop by forcing me to eat five pounds of rice pudding (a task that took me close to two hours) after catching me sampling the pudding while I waited on a customer at the deli counter.\n\nI couldn\'t resist stopping in front of the butcher shop on my way to the spot I\'d picked out three-quarters of a mile away to set up my stand. As Joe, Vinny, and Joe\'s nephew, Patsy, came out to see the new stand, I was gloating over the fact that I was now just as independent in business as they were. Nobody could make me clean out the rotten chicken tank anymore. Nobody could send me five miles away on the delivery bike in the snow to deliver ribs to a rich finicky lady who would just send them back to be trimmed, and never tipped more than a quarter. Nobody could make me lay in the sawdust and dig ground-up bones, blood, and fat out of the meat band saw. And, most importantly, nobody could do all this while poking fun at what a jerk I was to get all the dirty jobs. I was only fourteen years old, and the wheels would fall off my homemade hot dog stand many times before that summer ended, but that day, in my mind, I was as rich as a Rockefeller.\n\n\n']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"the telephone industry.

But the two new species,\notiorhynchus armadillo and otiorhynchus salicicola, not previously known\nnorth of Switzerland, are now prevalent in south London. ""It\'s very likely\nthese weevils have been introduced to Britain through imported ornamental\nplants from Italy,"" said Dr Barclay. ""It looks like they\'re here to stay.""\nHe found otiorhynchus armadillo on the window of a Chelsea department store\nin 1998, but as the shop sold imported house plants, he assumed it was a\nmigrant. It has now quietly become the most common species of vine weevil in\nsouth-west London. The second invader is not so numerous, but has\nestablished itself firmly in the same area.\nApart from laurels, vine weevils attack bay, viburnum, ornamental ivy, and\ngrape vines. An early sign of trouble is that notches appear in leaves. The\nsoil-dwelling larvae bite the roots off below the surface.\nOne possible explanation for the invaders\' successful colonisation of\nBritain is global warming. Earlier springs and milder winters are already a\nfact.\n\n\n------------------------ Yahoo!

Musicians performing at the event include: the Box Set\nDuo - clown princes of folk-rock, the classic funk band Funkmonsters,\nceltic world-fusion group Hy Brassyl, harmony based folk-pop band\nAtticus Scout, and Berkeley-based party band Shady Lady.\n\nIn addition to music, the Share-In will feature performers including\nAshley Foster the One Wheeled Wonder, the Existential Circus,\nFrantastic Hands, the Metronome Dancers, and Willy Bologna and his\nSideshow Circus.

The OAL encourages\ncollaboration, providing artists with an alternative to a business\nmodel strictly driven by profit. Based on the open source and free\nsoftware initiatives for software development, the OAL encourages\nartists to share with one another and their fans\n\nAdoption of the OAL does not mean that artists go unrewarded for their\nwork. On the contrary, the OAL permits artists to share single tracks\nor performances and gain widespread recognition for their work without\nrelying on intermediaries. EFF encourages new models of music\ndistribution in the digital world that benefit the artists themselves.\nThe Internet makes it possible to drastically reduce the overhead for\npackaging and distributing music, which is where record companies\ncurrently spend most of the money that could be going to artists.

Blonds, It Seems, Will Survive After All\n\nOctober 2, 2002\nBy LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN \n\n\n\n\n \n\nApparently it fell into the category ""too good to check.""\n\n\nLast Friday, several British newspapers reported that the\nWorld Health Organization had found in a study that blonds\nwould become extinct within 200 years, because blondness\nwas caused by a recessive gene that was dying out. The\nreports were repeated on Friday by anchors for the ABC News\nprogram ""Good Morning America,"" and on Saturday by CNN. \n\nThere was only one problem, the health organization said in\na statement yesterday that it never reported that blonds\nwould become extinct, and it had never done a study on the\nsubject. \n\n""W.H.O. has no knowledge of how these news reports\noriginated,"" said the organization, an agency of the United\nNations based in Geneva, ""but would like to stress that we\nhave no opinion of the future existence of blonds."" \n\nAll the news reports, in Britain and the United States,\ncited a study from the World Health Organization - ""a\nblonde-shell study,"" as The Daily Star of London put it.\nBut none reported any scientific details from the study or\nthe names of the scientists who conducted it. \n\nOn ""Good Morning America,"" Charles Gibson began a\nconversation with his co-anchor, Diane Sawyer, by saying:\n""There\'s a study from the World Health Organization, this\nis for real, that blonds are an endangered species. Women\nand men with blond hair, eyebrows and blue eyes, natural\nblonds, they say will vanish from the face of the earth\nwithin 200 years, because it is not as strong a gene as\nbrunets."" \n\nMs. Sawyer said she was ""somewhat of a natural blonde.""\n\n\nJeffrey Schneider, a spokesman for ABC News, said the\nanchors got the information from an ABC producer in London\nwho said he had read it in a British newspaper. \n\nIn London, The Sun and The Express both reported that\nunnamed scientists said blonds would survive longest in\nScandinavia, where they are most concentrated, and expected\nthe last true blond to hail from Finland. \n\nThe British accounts were replete with the views of\nbleached blonds who said hairdressers would never allow\nblondness to become extinct, and doctors who said that rare\ngenes would pop up to keep natural blonds from becoming an\nendangered species. \n\nJournalists in London said last night that the source of\nthe reports was probably one of several European news\nagencies that are used by the British press, but it\nremained unclear which one. \n\nTim Hall, a night news editor at The Daily Mail, said the\nreport was probably distributed by The Press Association,\nBritain\'s domestic news agency. ""Several papers picked it\nup,"" he said. \n\nBut Charlotte Gapper, night editor at The Press\nAssociation, said that although it had considered running\nthe report on Sept. 27, it had decided not to after talking\nto the World Health Organization. \n\n""We didn\'t do that story because we made an inquiry to the\nWorld Health Organization first,"" she said. ""They told us\nthat report was two years old, and had been covered at the\ntime. They said it had been picked up again that day by a\nGerman news agency."" \n\nShe added that she did not know which agency the\norganization was referring to. \n\nDr. Ray White, a geneticist at the University of California\nat San Francisco, said that the disappearance of a gene for\nblond hair ""sounds patently incorrect.""\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/02/health/02BLON.html?ex=1034599071&ei=1&en=3a0e4f0b2b251593\n\n\n\nHOW TO ADVERTISE\n---------------------------------\nFor information on advertising in e-mail newsletters \nor other creative advertising opportunities with The \nNew York Times on the Web, please contact\nonlinesales@nytimes.com or visit our online media \nkit at http://www.nytimes.com/adinfo\n\nFor general information about NYTimes.com, write to \nhelp@nytimes.com.  \n\nCopyright 2002 The New York Times Company\n\n\n']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"was ""not likely to cause cancer.""\n\n\n

But, in all probability: no, it isn\'t usually worth it. So, it\ncomes down to how difficult you want to make the cracker\'s job.\n\nIf the product requires occasional authentication, simple copying\nwon\'t work; the product has to be cracked. In which case, the issue is\nwhether you\'re actually going to enter into battle with the crackers,\nor just make sure that it isn\'t trivial.\n\nA lot of it comes down to your customer base. Teenage kids tend to be\nmore concerned about cost and less concerned about viruses/trojans,\nand so more willing to use warez. Fortune-500 corporations are likely\nto view matters differently.\n\n> Does it really make it more secure ?\n\nYes; software techniques will only get you so far. Actually, the same\nis ultimately true for hardware, but cracking hardware is likely to\nrequire resources other than just labour.\n\nAlmost (?) anything can be reverse engineered. But it may be possible\nto ensure that doing so is uneconomical.\n\n> Look at the DVDs.\n\nIIRC, CSS was cracked by reverse-engineering a software player; and\none where the developers forgot to encrypt the decryption key at that.\n\n-- \nGlynn Clements <glynn.clements@virgin.net>\n\n']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"your questions is appreciated .
