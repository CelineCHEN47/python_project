darren :
i ' m not sure if you can help me with this , but i don ' t know who else to ask . for april and may , we have gas pathed on deal 133304 to conoco at the gepl big cowboy point . conoco is saying that we did not buy that gas from them . they have accounted for all of the hpl big cowboy gas and think we have over paid by about $ 1 . 5 mil each month for the gepl gas . do you know why we added the gepl meter to the deal in april ? could we have bought this gas from someone else ? i have the meter statements from tejas , but they do not say who the supply company was .
megan","Regarding Conoco's Gas Pathing, Darren, it seems that you are missing someone who might be able to help. Please clarify if this is the individual you are referring to, and if so, provide any relevant information about the gas they purchased from us. As mentioned in the emails, we did not purchase gas from them. Conoco has accounted for all of their HPL big cowboy gas and believe that they have overpaid by approximately $1.5 million annually for the gepl gas. If this is the reason behind adding the gepl meter to deal in April, could you kindly confirm if this is indeed the individual you are referring to? We will ensure transparency in our dealings with the relevant parties. Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,
Megan

california  , s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last several
months . unfortunately , this debate has generated more heat than light . we
want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis .
please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation
and our position on california energy issues .
what happened in california
the source of california  , s current problem is as straightforward as supply
and demand . california  , s economy grew 29 percent since 1998 . this increased
the demand for electricity by 24 percent . at the same time , regulatory
restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state . so
demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added . the result ,
predictably , is a shortage . this summer , peak capacity will be about 10
percent shy of peak demand , leading to further blackouts in the state .
in addition to the supply and demand imbalance , there are two other related
factors that led to the current crisis . first , the state  , s regulations
forced all sales and purchases into the spot market . the spot market for
power is extraordinarily volatile . the way firms behave in a free market
when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases long
term , medium term and short term , to reduce exposure to this volatility . in
california , state regulation prevented this strategy . this would be the
equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in the
most volatile interest rate environment imaginable . everything was fine
while the power surplus persisted , but when shortages ensued , every megawatt
was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price .
second , retail markets were not deregulated . regulated retail rates remained
in effect , and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep
competition out . this meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesale
prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the
regulated retail rate . they are now nearly bankrupt .
in short , california  , s problems were caused by regulation , not deregulation .
regulations prevented competitors from entering the market , prevented new
generation from being built , and prevented prudent hedging against volatile
spot prices .
at the time california was developing its restructuring plan , enron warned
the state  , s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives , which ,
if adopted , would have averted the current crisis .
enron  , s role
many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than fix
the problem . power sellers , including enron , have been vilified by the
politicians and the media . here are the facts :
? other than a small amount of wind power , enron is not a generator in the
state of california . every megawatt we sold in california we bought in the
same market available to other california purchasers . because we are a
market maker , not a generator , we are not biased toward high prices . we are
interested only in having a market that works so that we can package products
for our customers .
? as a seller to end - use markets in the state , we provided protection from
the problems the states  , utilities , and their customers , now face . we
protected , and still protect , our customers from price volatility .
you may have read that ees recently elected to have the utilities supply
power directly to its customers in california instead of procuring power on
the open market . early reports mischaracterized this as a  enron continues to sign up customers in the state ; and enron
continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in western
power markets . enron  , s primary business is managing risk for our customers
with solutions customized to meet their needs . there has never been more
demand for our products and services .
the solution
the solution to california  , s crisis is also straightforward . in summary , the
state must increase supply , reduce demand , reduce reliance on the spot market
and shore up the financial stability of the state  , s utilities .
increasing supply
california  , s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing
short of byzantine . enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in less
than a year . in california , it often takes 5 to 7 years . california simply
must streamline this process . ironically , while many of the regulations
generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality , the
regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and
displacing current plants , which emit 40 times as much nox . california can
have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new
facilities .
reducing demand
customers in california today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand .
they pay the same rate no matter what the market price is . an open retail
market would trigger demand responses , which would balance supply and demand
at lower prices than today . california should fully open its retail market .
reducing reliance on the spot market
in a truly deregulated market , customers would protect themselves from
volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer
term , fixed - price basis . the state has instead left procurement in the hands
of the utilities , which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market .
opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over their
price risk .
restoring the financial integrity of the state  , s institutions
the utilities in california are not paying their bills . this has led to
greater uncertainty in the market , higher costs , and reduced flexibility to
arrive at lasting solutions . california must permit its utilities to recover
their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and
distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is
needed .
just as important as doing these things , the state must avoid policies that ,
while politically attractive , do not fix the problem or even make matters
worse . price caps have been proposed . they don  , t work ; have never worked ;
and they will not work here . price caps succeed only in creating shortages ,
which then have to be allocated among competing users . imagine how
ineffectively the government would be in determining , for example , whether it
is better to make its limited power supplies available to the imperial valley
or silicon valley . price caps are a surefire way to make the current
shortage worse .
the state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in
california . there is no reason to believe , and every reason to doubt , that
the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in ,
constructing , operating and maintaining assets . this will also result in
california tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power
generation - - which the private sector can do - - instead of education , roads
and other public goods - - which the private sector cannot do .
as you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about the
crisis from the media , it  , s important for you to know this : we at enron will
continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real
solutions to the state .","Reply: Subject: California Energy Crisis Overview and Concerns

i have reviewed the gas composition analysis from spl of the basin production
from ga 213 . while spl ' s analysis does show a dewpoint of around 20 degrees
f at 400 psig , it is both my and john handley ' s opinion that the gas from the
wellbore had stratified by the time that this sample was taken . we expect
the dewpoint of the flowing gas to be higher . however , this was the best
sample that could be obtained at the time . we have conferred with steve
schneider and we are willing to take this gas on a conditional basis over the
next couple of days . once the 6 "" line has been pigged , the production flows
stablilized and mitchell ' s conditioning equipment lined out over the next
couple of days , hms will need to take another sample at the meter run and
have spl run an extended analysis with a dewpoint curve on an expedited
basis . should this sample indicate a dewpoint over 45 degrees f , then this
production will be shut in again until hydrocarbon dewpoint conditioning
equipment has been installed . in the meantime , hms needs to keep a close
watch on all southern union city gates on galveston island to monitor for

the following additions and modifications to stack manager will be effective as of saturday september 8 , 2001 .
stack manager modifications
inactivate all stack - in addition to the individual activate / inactive stack buttons , there is now an inactivate all stack button . similar to the suspend all button , this button will inactivate the trader ' s stack on all active products . any existing top of stack limit orders will continue to post to the website and remain transactable . see screen shot below : inactivate all stack button on far right .
please note that we have switched the positions of the suspend and inactivate buttons in stack manager .
fill order - if a product is set up as either restricted top of stack or top of stack the trader now has the ability to automatically fill any order that is at the top of the stack . in order to fill a limit order that is at the top of the product ' s stack , which will appear in pink , the trader should right click anywhere on the stack window and choose "" fill order "" . the volume filled on an order will be that which is offered by the trader . in order to fill the complete volume of the order , the trader will need to adjust the volume in his stack .
floated stack windows - if the stack is inactive on a product , the price and volume fields on the my products tab will continue to be blank . on the depth window and floated stack window of these products the trader ' s prices will be in gray and italics . children of products that have inactive stacks will not be gray and italicised in the floated stack windows and will not see the calculated prices .
no auto inactivate stack - it is now possible to keep a product active even if the trader is not logged into stack manager . if the trader wishes to enable this functionality on the upper right corner of the product properties page the trader should choose "" no auto inactivate when stack manager is down "" .
changes regarding suspension of products
stack manager will inactivate products rather than suspend them in the following cases :
? market close - if a product is active at the end of its trading hours its stack will automatically become inactive rather than suspending . in order to keep a product ' s stack active past the set trading hours , the trader should choose "" keep awake "" next to the trading hours section of the product properties page .
? auto suspend now inactivates stack - on a product with the auto suspend function enabled to monitor the price changes on the product , the product ' s stack will be inactivated if the suspend at level is reached . this feature can be used by checking the enable box on the product properties page under the auto suspend section .
? logging out of stack manager - when you log out of stack manager without inactivating or suspending your products , the system will now inactivate your products rather than suspending them .

for williams and apache . on williams deal 384237 , the demand charge needs to
be removed from sept . 2000 . the demand charge should not have started until
october 2000 . because we did not know at the time what was happening with
this deal , the demand fee was inadvertently paid to williams for sept . and we
need to recoup our money . on apache deal 384247 , james thinks we need to
remove the demand charge completely . he says it is not a part of the deal
and apache is not billing us for it . we also need to talk about the pricing
on both of these deals . williams and apache are billing us less than what we
have in sitara . to be able to keep this desk at zero , jim pond does not want
me to use pay the lesser of for the purchases , so we need to address the
price differences . you said you had some contract briefs that supported our
prices . please fax a copy to me at 713 - 646 - 8420 and i will compare them to
what james has .
just a heads up . . . we are beginning to work on november 2000 , so we will need

Reply: Regarding Tenaska IV Pricing Legislation, I understand your concern regarding the demand charge for Williams and Apache. While we acknowledge that we are responsible for billing Williams and Apache for certain transactions, we also have the obligation to ensure that billing is accurate. The cost of the new billing model will be reflected in the new invoice if applicable. In this case, the billing should be reflected in the invoice instead of the existing one. To ensure consistency, please provide me with the necessary details for accurate billing for Williams and Apache. Thank you for bringing this matter to my attention.

Reply: Subject: Re: Fw: First Delivery - Rodessa Operating Co. Oxygen Co. Oxygen

Regarding your query about the first delivery, I have spoken with Vance and he stated that it was the same well they nominated during BidWeek. I will ask Julie to change the price to gas daily. Thank you for bringing this matter to my attention. Regarding the nomination of Oxygen Co., it appears that they are the same well that they nominated during BidWeek, which is accurate. If they are not part of the same well, then we can proceed with altering the gas daily price accordingly.

Regarding the new well behind the meter, please note that they were nominated during BidWeek. If it is a new one, we can either create a new deal ticket for Oxygen Co. Oxygen within the existing deal ticket or create a pricing tier for Oxygen Co. Oxygen. Oxygen Co. Oxygen Oxygen is a new company, and they are currently in a temporary sale with no new deal tickets. We are currently working on implementing these changes and will notify you of any changes once we have completed them.

Regarding the new well with the same name and meter number, I understand that they are currently in a temporary sale with no new deal tickets. Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns regarding this matter.

they had balances in it .
i also spoke to jim tobacco at epgt for at least an hour or so , going over every line item which was rejected , please get with me once you are back in the office

i met with richard and reviewed november transactions for epgt to determine if we could eliminate the external pools but unfortunately we cannot do this .
if we transport then we must use the external pool . however , you do not need to use internal pools but must use the imbalance pools which you are currently

please review the changes and let me know if this will work for you . .
i will be in touch with you after i meet with el paso .","Dear Mike,

Thank you for your email regarding the termination of inactive inter pipes and internal pools. I have reviewed the changes made by Esther and identified the need to consider alternative solutions. I understand that the external pools will be removed from EPGT's portfolio, which is why we are not utilizing them. Esther and I are working with the relevant departments to ensure that all necessary adjustments are made for efficiency and compliance.

Please review the updated list of inactive pools and ensure that you review the specific requirements. If there are any discrepancies or concerns, kindly let me know and I will address them promptly.

Dear All,

Thank you for your interest in our services. As discussed, we have been collaborating with Driscoll Ranch on the project. We have been evaluating the feasibility and current state of the project and will keep you updated as we progress. As you mentioned, we have identified the key components and objectives of this project.

1. The Crosstex Energy Services project will involve an energy generation and transmission system (ERC) located in the Crosstex Energy Services facility near downtown Houston. This system will provide reliable power supply for the entire Houston region, including the Crosstex Center.

2. The project involves a $600 million investment from Enron North America Corp., which will be invested in a power plant in San Antonio with capacity of approximately 5 MW. We are also working with Enron North America on a project that will be completed in the next few months.

3. As a result of this investment, we will have a capacity of approximately 25 MW in 2021. The existing capacity will be utilized for the Houston region.

We aim to provide a high-quality energy source for the Houston region through a long-term partnership that aligns with our company's needs. We look forward to your continued collaboration and collaboration with us.

assignment )
changing counterparty names on sitara deal tickets has absolutely no impact
to any downstream processes .
i hope the following will give more clarification .
let me know if you have any questions or need more detail !
thanks ,
dg 3 - 9517
sitara / unify - process
* scenario - counterparty name changes on sitara deal ticket after deal had
been pathed , scheduled & bridged back from unify .
* impact - zero impact to logistics & volume management , absolutely
harmless . settlements has process in place to eliminate issues .
* process -
counterparty a in sitara changes to counterparty b .
ctprty a was on original path sent to pipeline .
the new name ( ctprty b ) does bridge over to unify .
ctprty a remains at the path level in unify ( gui display does not change )
ctprty b is now displayed at the deal level in unify . the field is now
highlighted to indicate a change occurred . ( gui display changes only at high
level , not on path )
the scheduler has choice to repath ( if necessary ) , or not re - path
if re - pathing occurs , the new counterparty name will be displaced on new path
unify pushes back the deal number & meter to sitara ( not ctprty info )
balancing works on deal number & meter only ( not ctprty info )
the confirmation desk utilizes the information in sitara ( where all
information is correct )
volume management utilizes the information in unify for pipeline tie - out .
( all information sent to pipeline is correct at the path level and will match
up perfectly )
settlements utilizes information in unify .
settlements recognizes that changed ctprty names changes contracts , which
would create two notification entries
if invoice did happen to go out to wrong ctprty , re - draft would occur .
( note : there was an issues discovered on reports which it is correcting now )
autonoms "" tom ' s words of warning "" -
previously there was an issue when counterparty name changes took place after
deals were pathed and nominated . basically it would change a key on an edi
path ( duns number ) not affecting any other of the information already
nominated to the pipeline . if the scheduler re - nominated , data at the
pipeline would get doubled up and the scheduler would have no way to correct
the problem . in most cases , the schedulers would have to get the pipeline to
manually cut the original nominated volume . this is not an issue with unify
( as explained above ) .

fyi . . . .
this change went in for the deal validation group . it gives them the
ability to change counterparties names after bridge back .
impact to logistics - unify
if a counterparty name change takes place to deals that have been bridge
backed , it could cause problems on edi pipes as that new counterparty name
will flow over to unify and repathing should eventually take place .
one problem may be with the imbalance data sets , which are not in production
yet . . . . . . ( edi imbalance qtys would not match up to paths )
this may also cause an issue with the scheduled quantities ( especially where
nominations were sent for entire month )
can ' t remember the rules on this one , but i think unify does have some safe
guards ( idiot proofs ) to force re - pathing .
unify does have the ability to over - ride duns numbers , yet would still cause
an additional step for edi the scheduler would need to think through in order
to get a clean quick response .
what are ( if any ) impacts to vol mgt if counterparty name changes take
place ? ( prior periods ? re - pathing ? )
i have a call into diane and dave both . after speaking w / them , hopefully i
can get a clear understanding of the true impact . i am sure we ' ll need to
put some processes and procedures together for deal validation to follow when
these type of changes are needed .
will keep you posted .

subject : sitara release ( re : changes in global due to consent to assignment )
regarding the ability to change counterparties on deals in sitara with
confirmed volumes - tom ' s words of caution :
if someone calls you and wants to change a counterparty - we created the
ability for you to invalidate the deal - and
then change the counterparty - however - i did add a warning message :
"" warning - changing counterparty on deal with confirmed volumes - make sure
pipeline allows this change . ""
some pipelines do not allow us to change counterparties after there is
feedback - i assume for the same reasons
we had this rule - it used to blow up our old scheduling systems
( pre - unify ) . some pipelines will require a new
deal and we will have to zero out the old deal .
before you make the change - make sure the logistics person is aware - just
in case it causes problems with their
pipeline . sorry - i don ' t know which pipes these are - you will have to ask
the unify team .
there is one rule still in place - you can change from ena - im east to ena - im
market east - but not from
ena - im texas to hplc - im hplc - when changing business units - they must be
the same legal entity .
"" warning - not the same legal entity ""
also - beware of making contract and counterparty changes to service deals
( transport capacity , storage , cash out ) .
once the deal is invalidated - there are no rules . don ' t forget - the items
were locked down for a reason .
if you invalidate a service deal - and change the previously locked down
data that was validated - and someone used these
deals in unify - it is highly likely that the unify deals and paths created
using these deals will get corrupted . always check
with someone from unify to make sure no one used these deals for anything in
unify .

subject : sitara release ( re : changes in global due to consent to assignment )
with the release that was put out tuesday evening , deal validation should be
able to change the counterparty on deals where the volume is something other
than expected ( e . g . confirmed , nominated , scheduled , etc . ) .
in addition , this release will also capture "" near - time "" the contract changes
that are made in global . this means that need for server bounces will not be
necessary .
new / changes to contracts will show up without having to get out of deal
manager .
new counterparties , and new / changes to facilities will require getting out
of all active sitara apps ( except for launch pad ) .
once out of all apps , start a new app - the respective information that you
are looking for will appear .
i mention "" near - time "" because we are constrained by the amount of time it
takes for the change in global data to trigger an alert for sitara who then
updates its information

Reply: Regarding the Sitara release (re: changes in global due to consent touania assignment), the changes in counterparty names are quite minimal. In the event of any downstream processes impacting Sitara deal tickets, please note that these changes are temporary and cannot impact our operations. However, if you require additional information or clarification on these matters, feel free to contact me. Thanks for your understanding and cooperation.

Reply: Regarding Meter 9707 Regarding Purchase from United Oil & Minerals (previously Meter 9707), Vance mentioned that he had received an email from the company concerning the purchase from their counterpart, Oxygen Exploration and Production. However, it seems that Oxygen Exploration had not yet made any deals with them. The information you provided seems to be incorrect, as it appears Oxygen Exploration had previously agreed to purchase Meter 9707 from Oxygen Exploration but had not confirmed their involvement with Oxygen Exploration in this transaction. We apologize for any confusion this may have caused.

Regarding Meter 9707's status, Vance mentioned that he had received an email from Oxygen Exploration informing him that they had not yet made a deal with them regarding Meter 9707. This may have been due to a misunderstanding caused by the previous email from Oxygen Exploration, which may have been accidentally received by you. We apologize for any inconvenience caused and will work towards resolving the matter promptly. Please let us know if you require any further assistance or have further questions.

Reply: Regarding Meter 9707's status, I have reviewed the situation and will address the discrepancies mentioned in your previous email. As per Vance's message, he mentioned that they had indeed received a new deal from Oxygen Exploration.

Regarding the February deal for TeCo Gas Processing Ltd., it appears that there is a deal for Meter 6884 for February, but for a different meter. Meter 138095 for Meter 6331 is still in operation. Could you please confirm if this deal should be extended or if it has been canceled? It appears to be a different meter, so it would be beneficial to know if this meter has been updated to reflect the updated information. Thank you for your assistance.

what is involved in changing a product description to include this phrase ? i do have some customers in texas that are legally bound to only trade intrastate gas and they are fearful of trading anything that doesn ' t specifically state that .
since it is probably only a handful of customers , if it is a major production , it may not be worth it , but i wanted to check .

sandi ,
sorry for just now getting back with you . i was out last week .
the rate ( $ . 04 / mmbtu ) will be charged on the greater of the volumes nominated
on the supply contracts or the actual deliveries to the plant . the fee will
be adjusted yearly based on cpi .
bob - i could not remember if we stated the type of settlement on the
delivered volumes ( actuals or nominations ) . i think we should use actuals
due to possibility that the plant could over pull with out our knowledge on a
daily basis . we would receive the estimates / actuals on a lag and may have to
purchase gas to offset the imbalance , even though the plant kept the noms at
the 45 , 000 base . i also think that if the plant does increase the nom , they
are more likely to pull the additional volume rather than pulling less . do
you agree with this ?

daren ,
when we met regarding the rate for the tenaska gas management agreement , you
guys mentioned that it would be tied to an index - - could you restate for me
how that is to work - - it will start out 4 cents per mmbtu based on the greater
of the volumes nominated through the supply contracts or the actual
deliveries to the plant . then the fee will vary month to month ? year to year ?
based on what index ?
thanks ,
sandi","mbtu ) was $ . 04 .
thanks !

Reply: Regarding the rate for Tenaska deal LTD, I apologize for the delay. While I understand your concern about CPI and its relation to Consumer Price Index (CPI), I am uncertain as to whether it stands for CPI or CPI-Upper, which is an index of fixed income. To address this, I'll look into it further and gather further information on CPI-Upper.

Regarding CPI-Upper, the rate ($.04/mmbtu) was $.04. It is possible that it is a different measurement, or that it is a different product of CPI-Upper. To clarify, CPI-Upper is a basket of fixed income (interest expense) which includes interest income and capital costs, while CPI-Upper is a basket of capital costs that includes interest expenses and capital expenditure. CPI-Upper does not include any specific expenses or capital expenditures. The difference between CPI-Upper and CPI-Upper is a percentage of the total cost of capital expenditure. It is crucial to keep this distinction in mind when determining the appropriate CPI-Upper measure.

I will contact relevant stakeholders to provide a comprehensive assessment of CPI-Upper and CPI-Upper. In the meantime, please feel free to let me know if you have any further questions or concerns. Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

20 , 000 mmbtu were confirmed for adonis in pops . 10 , 000 mmbtu on day 5 and

10 , 000 was confirmed . the actual sale to adonis was 10 , 000 which was
invoiced and paid by adonis . we are trying to clear the feedback error
report . my question is why was 10 , 000 confirmed on 1 / 16 / 99 if the date is
not valid for the deal ?
when karen allocates the actual 10 , 000 it is prorating 5 , 000 for each day
that is confirmed ( the 5 th and 16 th ) .
should the whole 10 , 000 be allocated to the 5 th or should 5 , 000 be allocated
to each day ? if 5 , 000 should be allocated to each day , the 16 th needs to be
added to the deal .","farmer / hou / ect on 08 / 23 / 2000

Reply: Regarding Meter 984132 for January 16, 1999, it appears there was a delivery nomination of 10.0 Pathed to EnNA Orion with a volume of 201 K. This discrepancy is likely due to the discrepancy in meter numbers and the mis-represents the deal for that day. It's also worth noting that Meter 984132 on January 16 was allocated incorrectly in POPs and a deal was not pathed correctly in POPs. To clarify, Meter 984132 on January 16 was allocated to POPs, and Meter 984132 on January 16 was allocated to POPs. Please review the given information and let me know if you require further clarification or assistance on this matter.

Reply: Subject: Re: Documentographing Candidate Opportunity

Samantha, Regarding the candidate's opportunity, I appreciate your interest in seeking guidance on his candidacy. To schedule an interview with Mark McCoy, please schedule an appointment with him on Monday, January 24th at 7:30 AM in Room A-1. We have already met with him outside of the office on January 24th and have discussed his availability. He is currently employed outside of the office and has limited clout. His current employment status is likely to be a favorable one for him, but it is essential to consider him in light of his current circumstances.

Please ensure that we have the necessary information to evaluate his candidacy before considering any potential opportunities. Additionally, do not forget to include any potential opportunities that may arise if you deem necessary or if you would like to discuss his candidacy further with him. This way, we can make an informed decision regarding his candidacy for a suitable position within our organization. Thank you for considering this opportunity and considering my interest in exploring its potential.

Regards,

approval to write - off the volumes to unaccounted for gas loss
thanks , clem","Regarding your query, the meter number 981488 Paris Tenaska HPL IOC is currently experiencing fluctuations. As per our records, these fluctuations have impacted the recorded volumes. The deal ticket #/product (seller/buyer) associated with this meter was extended on November 29th, 1999, but it expired on November 30th, 1999. Logistics needs either (1) a new deal with ID #124400 extended, (2) new ID #124400, or (3) approval to write-off these volumes to unaccounted-for gas loss. As per your request, please print, sign, and return original to Clem Cernosek. Thank you for your cooperation.

Regards,
John Smith

Reply: Subject: Re: Meter #1266, August 2000/Locating Exception (Expiration Date)

Regarding the meter allocation exception with regard to the August 2000 allocation exception, Conoco Transport has nominated 5.0/d at this meter. Conoco Transport can be allocated the entire meter flow for the days in which it exceeds the specified amount due to their limited capacity. Consequently, Conoco Transport can extract a sale from the excess meter flow for this allocation. The exception is related to the daily activities and does not apply to non-business activities. Regarding the daily activities mentioned in your email, I would like to remind you that Conoco Transport is the only party handling this allocation. Their allocation is as follows:

1. May - June - Total volumes:
2. July - Total volumes:

just so you know , this is what i sent redmond about that 311 case .

from : hull , bryan
sent : tuesday , august 14 , 2001 7 : 16 am
to : redmond , brian
subject : fw : section 311
brian , this is a pretty good explanation of the case thus far . . . . . .
commissioner wood is aware of the conflict between pg & e ( now epgt ) and southern union , probably because of lobbying by southern union , and that is why he raised the issue . southern union states in its initial brief ( # 9 below ) that it opposes the high demand rates that it says epgt proposes to charge for a service that does not incorporate the consumer protections of order no . 636 and argues that ferc should impose order no . 636 standards on pg & e . i was watching a video stream of the meeting , and the whole discussion seemed to come out of nowhere .
here are the facts in this case .
1 ) on december 20 , 1999 , pg & e texas pipeline , lp ( the predecessor to epgt texas pipeline , lp ) filed a petition with ferc for approval of transportation rates under section 311 along , as they were required to do . ( all intrastate pipelines that perform section 311 service must either have their rates approved by ferc or they must charge rates that are approved by a state regulatory body for a similar service . ) pg & e ' s filing proposed , in addition to the usual interruptible service , a firm section 311 service as well as an interruptible parking and lending service . pg & e also filed a revised statement of operating conditions to reflect the new services .
2 ) on february 25 , 2000 , southern union gas company , an intrastate transportation customer of pg & e , filed a late motion to intervene and raised issues which it stated should be addressed in a hearing . pg & e opposed the late intervention , but ferc granted it on april 14 , 2000 . ( pg & e stated that southern union was intervening in order to gain leverage in renegotiating its contract for intrastate service . )
3 ) southern union submitted data requests to pg & e on april 13 and april 17 . pg & e attempted to get a protective order issued , but ferc rejected their request .
4 ) a settlement conference was held on september 7 , 2000 .
5 ) a staff panel was convened on october 2 , 2000 , in order to conduct an advisory , non - evidentiary proceeding for oral arguments on the issues , with instructions to make recommendations to the commission within 90 days .
6 ) on november 1 , 2000 , ferc requested 5 pages of additional information from pg & e in order to complete the application in the proceeding , which pg & e provided on november 8 th . on december 8 th , pg & e provided additional information in response to a ferc data request .
7 ) on january 10 , 2001 , southern union submitted a proposed alternative to the cost of service and rate design that was filed by pg & e .
8 ) on january 17 , el paso field services informed ferc that pg & e texas pipeline , lp had been acquired by el paso on december 22 , 2000 , and that the name was changed to epgt texas pipeline , lp .
9 ) on january 24 , 2001 , epgt texas and southern union filed initial briefs .
10 ) on july 17 , 2001 , epgt filed supplemental comments in response to the discussion at ferc summarized below , where commissioner wood inquired about the extension of some order no . 636 and 637 provisions to section 311 service providers . epgt stated that , if ferc proceeds with this policy , it should do so in a generic rulemaking and not in an individual pipeline proceeding . on july 30 , 2001 , southern union filed reply comments opposing epgt ' s supplemental comments .
11 ) on august 3 , epgt filed an amended statement of operating conditions , which provides for electronic nominations , two additional nomination cycles , bumping , clarified and updated credit provisions , modified quality provisions to protect system integrity , and more clearly defined authorized overrun service .
the ngpa gives ferc authority over intrastate pipeline rates for section 311 service and requires that such service be provided on a non - discriminatory basis , but there is some question as to whether it gives ferc authority to require , for example , compliance with order nos . 636 and 637 .
please let me know if this is enough detail ( or maybe it ' s more than you wanted ! ! ) .","met with sherriff s . archer , mike a . baughman , and sherriff k . roberts

Reply: Thank you for bringing up the topic of prayer and reconciliation. As a concerned parent, I understand that your concerns may lead to conflict, and it's crucial that we address these issues together. However, I understand that we must not let our children be separated from God's grace. We need to pray together, and we must continue striving towards reconciliation and growth through faith in Christ. We can work towards a more accepting and accepting environment where all of us can thrive together.

If any of us feel that our faith is at risk or if there are concerns about our faith, kindly find a suitable way to communicate these concerns directly to your church or the appropriate authorities. This way, we can ensure the best possible outcome for all involved. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further guidance.

Regarding the storage availability for PG&E, I understand that they do not have storage on PG&E. However, I believe that the schedule for Spindletop and Bammel is appropriate for them as well. Regarding the schedules for Spindletop and Bammel, please provide the details you provided for both. Regarding the availability of storage for PG&E, we have not had a confirmed date yet but should be ready by the scheduled date. Regarding the availability of storage for PG&E's storage on PG&E's behalf, we are awaiting their response. Thank you for your prompt attention.

for prior periods - i am not sure if you need to handle this using the
instructions below - or if for prior months only - if you would be allowed
to create a
cashout ticket to clear out any prior period imbalances . your controller
and volume management ( kathy kelly ) should make this call .
kim and david can brain check me on this - but i think this is how parking
should be done ; however ,
please verify with west or east desk economics to ensure accuracy / consistency .
parking procedures
create a storage deal in sitara - service type : parking
use this service deal to path to a storage account in unify - this way you
have accounted for the gas in unify
inject into storage account
withdrawal from storage account
( when you do the opposite of parking - withdrawal first - it is called a
"" loan "" )
create two economic deals in sitara - exchange deal
create an internal buy and sell of physical gas for economics and position
purposes - ( no invoices - fake 3 rd party )
exchange deal -
sell to cpr pipeline exchange ( parking gas )
buy from cpr pipeline exchange ( getting gas back )
within the month parking - no money exchanges hands - except any service fees
which can be recorded on the storage deal .
sell to cpr pipeline exchange ( parking gas ) - price = $ 0
buy from cpr pipeline exchange ( getting gas back ) price = $ 0
when the deal crosses a month - if you keep the risk within the desk - in the
short term you record a big loss - sell at $ 0 - and the
next month you record a big gain - buy at $ 0 . to manage this - usually the
cash desk swaps out the time risk to a storage financial book - who will pick
up the time
spread loss and offsetting gain - as this book captures forward value .
when you are adjusting your physical injections ( parking ) within the month -
you will need to
adjust your swaps too - which will adjust the p & l for the time spread
accordingly - otherwise you will have liquidation problems .
period 1 - sell to cpr pipeline exchange ( parking gas ) - price = $ 0 swap
to firm book for index + mid
period 2 - buy from cpr pipeline exchange ( getting gas back ) price = $ 0
swap to firm book for index + mid","Reply: Reply Body:

thank you ,

Reply: Regarding the hub park and lend agreement, Daren, I understand that we are not receiving timely information regarding the deal. While Mike has been communicating with them regarding the matter, we haven't received any official numbers from them yet. For ENA's credit and credit card obligations, we should at least be able to assess their potential liability for the $0.03/day rate. In case of a ""best available"" number, we should submit them by the first of the month for balance balance payments. As for the credit card obligations, we must await their approval before proceeding with any payments. I am working on preparing an updated list for you and will keep you updated on the progress of these matters. Please let me know if there are any additional concerns or questions.

Reply: Subject: Tenaska IV Outage Update

Regarding the Tenaska IV outage, I have already submitted nominations for the weekend of October 7th-9th. As per your message, the Cleburne plant will resume operations on Monday the 7th of October, taking all gas to the plant. If they arise early, we have imbalance gas that will serve them. If they are not present, we have a potential imbalance in the plant with a potential imbalance of approximately 25% of the gas supply. Please proceed accordingly, and I will ensure the necessary adjustments are made accordingly. Thank you for your cooperation in this matter.

Thank you for bringing this matter to our attention. I have reviewed the data from December 29, as per your request.

mark","Dear Mark,

Regarding the Conoco Supply cut on Oasis 5/21 and its impact on your Oasis production, please confirm if this was indeed a direct result of the cuts made by El Paso (#9 DWE) (#5/22) and their associated deal (#5/21 Nom). Conoco's supply from El Paso (#9) (#9) was cut into Oasis on May 21st, with the remaining cut of 601 being made in May 22nd. Conoco was able to maintain the original cut rate of 10,000; however, the remaining cut occurred on May 22nd. In this case, the cut was made at the same time as the previous one, with the exception of a specific deal (#5/21 Nom).

Conoco's total supply cut into Oasis from May 21st to May 22nd is approximately 1,688 MMbtu/d. If you need further clarification on these details, please feel free to contact us. We will keep you updated with any further developments.

Best regards,

Subject: Conoco Supply Cut on Oasis 5/21 - May 22nd (No Needed Details)

Dear Team,

I hope this email finds you well. Conoco Supply's recent supply cut into Oasis was indeed a direct result of the cuts made by El Paso (#9) (#5/22) and their associated deal (#5/21 Nom). Conoco was indeed responsible for maintaining the original rate of 10,000 MMbtu/d; however, it was not immediately clear if this was related to a specific deal or not. We will ensure to provide you with the necessary information once we have all relevant details. Kindly let us know if you require any further clarification on these matters.

in regards to meter 098 - 4179 the following information is what i have been
able to determine from the information available to me .
to your questions :
1 . cannot determine who owns this meter . i will contact molly carriere on
monday when she returns .
2 . hpl has a fifty ( 50 ) ft . easement at this location which does contain
language for appurtenance rights within the 50 ' .
3 . i pulled the meter file for this location which was prepared during
project rock and it does not contain a facility agreement so i am assuming
one was not located .
hope this helps .

shawna ,
attached is a contract preparation request for a facilities agreement for the
coastal oil the
legal department has prepared and is currently circulating a ratification and
consent to assign document to reflect this transaction .
we have been unable to locate an existing facility agreement for the 3
previously drilled wells and suspect that no such agreement exists .
the facility agreement requested herein is intended to cover only alterations
to be made to existing meter 098 - 4179 to install an h 2 s monitor and necessary
valving to allow hplc to accept gas from the newly drilled albrecht # 4 well .
once the h 2 s monitor has been installed and the albrecht # 4 well is ready to
flow , we intend to paper the purchase of gas from the albrecht # 4 well only
via a spot confirmation pursuant to a spot gtc . the albrecht # 4 will not be
covered by 96008903 , nor will the wells currently subject to 96008903 be
subject to the spot gtc .
coastal will reimburse hplc $ 39 , 600 for the cost of the installation .

we intend to attempt to connect about 4 , 000 mmbtu / d of new production from
the newly drilled coastal oil in may , 2000 , the meter flowed about 960
mmbtu / d of 3 . 36 % co 2 gas .
the content of the albrecht # 4 gas according to the field gas analysis
prepared by coastal oil the albrecht # 4 h 2 s content
is similar to that of the three wells currently producing 960 mmbtu / d behind
meter 098 - 4179 , the miller - albrecht unit # 1 - a and the hoff heller gas unit
# 1 a & # 2 d . coastal further purports that for some time now it ( and / or its
predecessor , mjg , corp . ) has treated these three wells for h 2 s in a manner
sufficient to reduce the h 2 s content delivered into hplc to permissible
levels . coastal has further indicated that it intends to reduce the h 2 s
content of the albrecht # 4 to permissible levels before delivering same to
hplc . in your opinion , should coastal be forced to install an h 2 s monitor
for this new gas prior to flowing same to hplc ?

small and the accuracy of the data at enerfin in question , why don ' t we let
this volume hit the new oba at enerfin as a ppa ? ? ?

invoiced and paid by adonis . we are trying to clear the feedback error

not valid for the deal ?
when karen allocates the actual 10 , 000 it is prorating 5 , 000 for each day
that is confirmed ( the 5 th and 16 th ) .
should the whole 10 , 000 be allocated to the 5 th or should 5 , 000 be allocated

added to the deal .","4 in mops ( hpl / ena ) there is a delivery nom of 6 . 0 pathed to the ena

Regarding the cp & l situation, I acknowledge your concern regarding the CP&L situation. While Bob's call for a spot deal seems appropriate, I understand the need for a tape that accurately represents the total flow of 6,289 mmbtu during that day. If you require any further clarification or assistance, please do not hesitate to reach out. I'm looking forward to working together towards resolving this matter.

the only valid "" buyback "" ticket for meter # : 1373 is sitara ticket # :
246408 . s . ticket # : 156342 is an old ticket which was used to set up
buyback
ticket across equistar ' s meters { 1552 , 1384 , 1062 , 1553 } . if you recall
this process was done to enable client services to automate equistar
allocation / billing . the project took place around april 2000
production retroactive back to jan . 1999 . the link to compute the buyback is
set up
on s . ticket # 246408 .
since equistar has begun doing business via ena , it was necessary to
establish a "" buyback ticket "" on ena ' s matrix .
thus , to answer your question , yes there should only be one "" buyback
ticket "" for meter # : 1373 on hpl and ena .
ena activity is kept whole and the swing is on hpl .
i hope i have addressed all of your questions below however , i am
available for follow up discussion if needed .
it has been a pleasure working with you . i learned a lot about the
business while scheduling industrials and thanks for the opportunity .

subject : equistar buybacks
robert ,
there are three buy back tickets in sitara for equistar at mtr 1373 . two for
hpl and one under ena . shouldn ' t we have only one buyback for each company ?
also , how do you have the meter set up to allocate between the ena contract
and hpl contract ?
d","Reply: Thank you for bringing this matter to our attention. Regarding Meter #1373, Sitara ticket #246408, and the associated buyback ticket for Meter #1373, it appears that the setup of Sitara ticket #246408 was indeed a successful process in facilitating Meter #1373's allocation and billing. It was indeed initiated around April 2000 with the intent of facilitating Equistar's coordination with ENA. Consequently, Sitara ticket #246408 has been set up on S. Ticket #246408. Likewise, ENA activities are managed via ENA, ensuring a smooth transition of Sitara ticket #26132.

As for Meter #1373, it appears to be a mixed case, but it appears that Sitara ticket #246408 was indeed set up to handle Sitara activities. However, since Meter #1373 has a different ticket number and meter number, it might be possible for Meter #1373 to utilize Sitara ticket #26132 instead. To clarify, Meter #1373 has a different deal number, Meter #26132, and Meter #1373 has a different deal number with Sitara ticket #246408, so we must determine the correct deal number for Meter #1373. Please let us know if you need any further assistance or clarification on this matter.

Dear Ami,

lee","Thank you for bringing this matter to our attention. We have reviewed the situation and will ensure that we proceed with our delivery to HPL Meter #1428. As per your request, please find below the details regarding the shutdown of Operations and the associated shut-down in DECO 0.

1. Beaumont methanol started their operation last night, but they will be down in Deco 0 due to high gas prices. This shutdown resulted in an ""out-of-control"" operation, which led to a decrease in gas supply to Coleman and a temporary closure of HPL Meter #1428.

2. Beaumont methanol's operations are now underway in Deco 0. We anticipate that the shut-down will last approximately 30 minutes.

3. Coleman will continue to operate under their current operations plan until it is determined that they can resume operations.

4. We are working closely with Coleman to ensure a smooth transition to normal operations.

Please let us know if you require further assistance or have any questions regarding this matter. We appreciate your cooperation in ensuring a smooth transition for our customers.

rita , please help me with this . i have some questions regarding enerfin .
why are we re - allocating prior month volumes at enerfin after we matched your
original numbers back in october ? can ' t this be fixed in the actualization
process ?
the numbers for october between ena - tetco and hpl vary a good bit . are we
your only customer at that point and why do we show volumes on days ena had
no transactions with hpl ? can we simply put zero paths in unify and extend
our existing deals in sitara with zero volumes and have you guys actualize
these small volumes to handle this ? we go round and round at this point
changing volumes two , three or more times . call me if you have questions . .

subject : re : hpl discrepancy
victor ,
the sitara ticket that we were using for the month of october is # 421415 .
tetco shows that the volumes that hpl was allocated on october 6 th and
october 19 th , were 9 dths and 44 dths , respectively . those volumes were
pulled off of our backhaul contract because there was no nomination in
place . this is the same problem that we have had over and over with them .
also , we just found out on tuesday , that the oba did not go into effect until
december 1 , 2000 . we were originally told that they were putting the oba in
effect retroactively to november of 1999 . in fact , i thought that hpl had
made a lot of retroactive changes in the system to adjust for the oba , do you
remember that ? hpl told us that ray calles at tetco is the one who decided
that the oba would not be effective until december of 2000 . nobody even
informed us of this change , i stumbled upon it when researching a november
issue for alfonso trabulsi and brenda fletcher . in addition to all of this ,
i received another email , which i will copy below , asking me to go in for the
month of october and adjust all of my estimated volumes in unify to match
what hpl shows that we were allocated . i had been going in all month long
and matching to their numbers , and we were clean for the deadline at the end
of the month . i ran the allocation report from tetco for the month of
october , and some of hpl ' s numbers were very different from tetco ' s ,
including the two days that i mentioned above . i sent jackie young an email
back showing her tetco ' s numbers and i haven ' t received a response . i will
copy that email below as well , just to catch you up on what ' s been going on .

subject : october volumes
hi jackie ,
i ran a report from tetco ' s system to show the volumes that enron was
allocated for the month of october , and some of the volumes are very
different from the volumes that you show . i copied your numbers below and
copied tetco ' s volumes below that ( with the disrepancies in red ) . i was
wondering if you could double check the 3 rd , 4 th , 11 th , 12 th , 25 th , and 27 th
to see if you had purchases on those days from a counterparty other than
enron north america at that meter . it looks like maybe the volumes that you
show are the total flow at that meter , but i think that only part of the gas
was actually allocated to us . i don ' t mind putting the allocated volumes in
path manager , but i ' d like to make sure that on the above days , i am only
putting in the amount that enron was allocated .
also , on the 6 th and the 19 th tetco shows exactly half of what you show ,
which i thought was kind of strange . i am going to have to get tetco ' s
permission to do a retroactive nomination for those two days at the volumes
you have requested , before i can put anything in sitara or unify . my manager
is out of the office and will be back tomorrow , but i would like for him to
double check the deal that we will have to create in sitara for those two
days , since we are dealing with a prior month issue .

Reply: Rita, regarding your query about Enerfin's discrepancy with our initial numbers, it appears that the reason behind their allocation is due to unforeseen circumstances. In October, when we matched the original numbers back in October, we had volumes on days ENA had Oxygen and Methanol transactions. Since then, we have allocated these volumes to Enerfin since then, resulting in a difference of approximately $1.3 million. We have made adjustments to our volumes with zero paths in Unify and are now reporting them to Sitara. Kindly provide us with the details of the impact on your end, and we'll ensure proper adjustments are made accordingly. Thank you for your cooperation.

Jackie, regarding deal extension for deal number 465490 for deal number 9/21/2000, I have not received any updates from either of you on the current status of the issue. Please find attached the updated deal extension for your reference.

Regarding the flow volume for the 11/21/2000 deal, we have indeed extended the deal to cover a flow volume of 141 dec., but it may not be in place yet. As you mentioned, there is an issue with the meter on the 8th floor which was originally scheduled for a flow volume of 140 dec., but now it's being extended to cover a volume of 140 dec. The meter will remain in service until the meter is back in service. If you have any further queries or require further information, kindly do not hesitate to contact me.

mark","Dear Mark,

Thank you for bringing Cleburne's imbalance to our attention. I have been monitoring the situation closely and have been informed about the potential impact on our operations. As we await Lisa's update on the situation, I would appreciate your guidance in addressing this matter.

As per our conversation, Cleburne's imbalance is due to a significant imbalance due to their oversupply. They are currently experiencing a significant imbalance due to the imbalance at the beginning of May, with an estimated imbalance of 240.0 due them. With the current situation, the plant is experiencing an overpull with an estimated imbalance of 240.0 due to Brazos taking over operations.

To address this imbalance, we should explore alternative options such as repurchasing or selling off the assets, potentially increasing their value to cover the excess demand. Please provide any necessary information or specific details that can help us better understand the situation better.

Should you have any additional concerns or require further clarification, feel free to contact me at your convenience. I am committed to working with you to ensure the best possible outcome for our operations.

are we charging enough for the swing we get at the paper plant on the entex
contract ?
is there a way to keep tejas in line at southern union this winter ? that
meter will really swing then and i do not know how much line pack they have
the right to use .
can we net the corpus christi gas marketing and all the tejas / coral / gulf

can we smash the entex and the reliant contracts together so we can get rid
of some of these contracts ? they have 9 , that seems like a lot to me .

need to compile this list and get tom and james comfortable with the
process . the last thing we need is the rrc hammering on us , when can we get
this list ? i think we should be able to get something out of the contract
system . jackie morgan is who i would approach .","columbia energy

Reply: Regarding the IOS issues, I agree with Robert's assessment of Moody's report and the need for balancing contracts. We need to find a solution that aligns with our objectives. Our primary focus should be addressing the imbalance issues and finding a mutually beneficial solution.

Regarding Duke Energy 206's outstanding issue, it seems like a large liability, but we need to address it internally. It's crucial to address this imbalance immediately. We will evaluate the situation internally to determine its impact on our overall budget and budgeting strategy.

Regarding the NGPL reconciliation, we need to identify a viable alternative solution to resolve the issue. I will get back to you with any updates as soon as possible on this matter.

rick ,
we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

Reply: Regarding the Tenaska IV Overview and Tenaska IV Overview for September, I would like to discuss the situation. Firstly, the current status of the situation is concerning our ability to continue our current role as agent of Tenaska IV. While Ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions in Texas due to the bankruptcy, it's crucial that we continue to maintain our current gas supply. Secondly, we are currently experiencing difficulties with locating counterparties to trade physical gas in Texas due to the absence of a favorable deal. We have been unable to sell gas at the hourly rate due to the bankruptcy and need to address this issue internally. We are currently working on resolving this issue internally. Regarding the remaining issues, we are working on addressing them. We are committed to finding an appropriate resolution and will keep you updated on any progress. Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Reply Body:
Regarding your email regarding the Berryman well situation, I am currently in the process of reviewing our current situation. I appreciate your concern about the imbalance at Gerritt's well. Regarding the impact Gerritt's nomination on our current month, I would like to confirm my understanding of the proposed adjustments and the potential impact Gerritt might have on our overall deal performance.

In terms of the Southern Power Plant nomination at Berryman, we are indeed underperforming, with a total of 76,162 Dth/mo, which is approximately equivalent to the difference between our volumes at Sitara and Garcia. As a result, I believe Gerritt should be able to bring the nominations up to balance with Garcia, and we should proceed accordingly. Please feel free to reach out with any questions or concerns regarding this matter.

Best regards,
Daren, I have been working on this matter for a few days now. I have been actively working towards finding a solution for the Berryman plant situation. I will be available to assist with any additional concerns or questions you may have regarding this matter.

As mentioned in James Armstrong's email, the purchase agreement covers Tenaska IV for September 2000 and October 2000, while the gas marketing agreement covers the remaining months of September 2000 and October 2000. If you require further information or clarification on this matter, please let me know. I will certainly reach out to you to discuss any possible adjustments or updates regarding the transactions.

Kind regards,

drama .
- - the school invented the phrase "" 12 th man "" and actually owns the

eric bass , texas desk trader , requested the following product described below
be traded on enrononline . this product will not bridge into sitara and will
have to be put in manually .
the reason it will not bridge is due to the fact that it can have multiple
stripes of start & end dates rather than one start & end date . currently ,
enrononline can
only send one start & end date per deal therefore it will fail in the bridge
monitor and will have to be manually entered into sitara & subsequently
cleared out of the monitor .
since these transactions could flow next day , it is imperative that these
transactions get into sitara as soon as possible . please read the full
description below . ( this product looks like a month long deal but excludes
weekends . the "" wkd "" is short for week days . )
we do not anticipate a large volume of these transactions but need to be
prepared to react quickly when they do . for the future , we are looking into
the cost / benefit of enrononline having the capability of sending multiple
dates for these types of products .
if you have any questions , please call me at 3 - 5824
thank you .

subject : 24 x 5 products
we are rolling out the use of the 24 x 5 nat gas product commencing tomorrow ,
may 24 th .
the product is a month - long physical nat gas product traded off the texas
desk . it will be identified as follows :
us gas phy exxon katy wkd juno 0 usd / mm
this product is different from the usual products traded on the texas desk in
that the product description has an
indicator of wkd , which designates that the product only moves gas on a day
that is a monday , tuesday , wednesday ,
thursday or friday .
these products will not bridge into sitara . risk personnel will need to be
diligent to identify these products based
on the information in the product description to ensure that the products are
entered into sitara correctly ( presumably -
strips of monday - friday trades and the corresponding month - starting days
and / or month - ending days ) .
we understand the potential impact of having to manually input these
transactions and have asked the appropriate
systems personnel to examine the links between eol and sitara and consider
building bridge capability . in the
interim , we anticipate that the trading volume on these products will be low ,
and will ask for higher prioritization of the
bridging in the event that volumes increase .

Reply: Regarding the deal extension for deal 34342 Oxygen, kindly advise if you would like to proceed with it. I understand your concerns regarding the lack of gas at Meter 1373 and your concern about not having the buyback. The deal has been extended until January 1st, which is why Sheila mentioned that it's a term deal expiring January 1st. As for the extension of this deal, I haven't had a chance to discuss it yet but will keep you updated once I have it.

al","Reply: Regarding Meter 1517 Oxygen, we had a slight discrepancy with the actual delivery on December 1st. We were unable to deliver gas to Phillips on December 2nd due to a plant issue. Therefore, we are currently in the process of verifying if Oxygen was delivered correctly on December 2nd. If this is indeed Oxygen, we will proceed with the delivery as per your request. Please keep me updated on any changes or concerns related to this matter. Thank you for bringing this matter to our attention.

Regarding Meter 1517 Oxygen, I have reviewed the situation and will proceed with the delivery as per your request. If there are any further questions or concerns, feel free to contact me. I appreciate your cooperation and look forward to working together towards finding a solution.

Dear Tom,

Thank you for your inquiry regarding the GMT Inc. LTD. LTD. meter. I have reviewed the information provided, and it appears that there are two variations. Firstly, the meter is named ""GTM 6353"" and it does not show the amount of gas flow during this time frame. Secondly, it seems there is no deal at this meter. If there are any concerns or questions regarding this meter, please feel free to reach out to me at extension 3 - 6353.

Regarding your request for gas to commence flowing on January 14, 2000, please note that the gas meter number is ""GTM 6353"". This is a separate meter with a different meter number and meter number than the one mentioned in your email. If you need to verify the meter details, kindly provide the relevant information for our records. We will ensure that all necessary information is accurate and complete for all parties involved.

Dear John, Robert, and Howard,

Thank you for your recent email regarding meter 5688 Mellody. I have reviewed the situation and found that it appears to be a miscommunication. The gas purchased by HPLC will be utilized by Meadowhill, with a total volume of 5688 MMBTUs. In regards to Meter 5688 Mellody's capacity, it will remain at 2/16, with a total volume of 4,488 MMBTUs. As for the meter's price, it will remain at $0.89/MMBTU for the specified duration, but it will be priced at $0.89/MMBTU per MMBTU. If you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me.

Reply: Subject: Re: Another Hesco Issue Violation

Dear Charlene,

I appreciate your concern regarding the Hesco issue. I have reviewed the situation and will address it accordingly. As mentioned, the price for the 29th of March 2000 was $2.85, with no deal for that day being entered into. As for the 30th of March 2000, we should not have booked any volume at that time. However, since gas did flow, I have determined that the last GOODMAN price was $2.85. Please proceed with confirming your decision.

Regarding the issue with the 29th of March 2000, I have reviewed the matter and will address it promptly. Kindly let me know if you require any additional information or clarifications.

Reply Body: Dear Charlene,

Thank you for bringing this matter to our attention. As discussed, we should not have scheduled a volume for the 29th of March due to its non-negotiated nature. As a result, we will not be able to proceed with the scheduled event for that day due to its non-negotiated nature. Kindly provide more information or clarify the reason behind this decision so we can address the issue promptly.

Kindly let me know if you require further assistance or clarifications.

Reply: Subject: Re: HPL Meter #980074 Bammel HPL D/P to Transcoinelli

Dear Aimee, Clem, and Team,

We understand your concerns regarding the HPL meter number 980074 Bammel HPL D/P to Transcoinelli. We are currently working on resolving this matter and have identified that Transco had allocated a different amount than our measurement. As per Fred's instructions, we will initiate writing off the difference between our current allocation and the relevant amount due to statute of limitations (6 GOODMAN months).

In February, Transco had a significant amount not allocated, and on February's significant amount, they were unable to proceed due to the statute of limitations (6 GOODMAN months). As a result, we will need a separate arrangement for writing off these volumes. Please provide us with the details of this matter so we can proceed accordingly.

We appreciate your cooperation in this matter. Kindly review the attached document and let us know if you have any questions or require additional information. Thank you for your patience.

1. Moody's's impact on our existing contracts, which is not mentioned in Moody's' report.

4. The recent financial news about Moody's has caused some concerns within our team, and we are currently assessing the impact of Moody's on our current and future contracts. Please provide more details on Moody's impact on Moody's and its impact on the current contracts as well as any potential impacts on our current contracts as well.

Kindly let me know if you require further information or assistance on this matter. Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.
