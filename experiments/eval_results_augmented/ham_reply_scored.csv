darren :
i ' m not sure if you can help me with this , but i don ' t know who else to ask . for april and may , we have gas pathed on deal 133304 to conoco at the gepl big cowboy point . conoco is saying that we did not buy that gas from them . they have accounted for all of the hpl big cowboy gas and think we have over paid by about $ 1 . 5 mil each month for the gepl gas . do you know why we added the gepl meter to the deal in april ? could we have bought this gas from someone else ? i have the meter statements from tejas , but they do not say who the supply company was .
megan","Regarding your query about the gas supply for April and May, I'm unable to help you with that matter. Conoco's statements on deal 133304, which include overpayments of $1.5 million each month by Calpine for HPL Big Cowboy, seem to be accurate. However, there seems to be confusion over who should be responsible for handling the gas supply for these months. Could you please clarify whether you need assistance in determining who should be responsible for handling these deals or if you need further clarification on the deal's origin? We would be happy to assist you in addressing this matter. Thank you for bringing this up.

0,"Subject: california energy crisis
california  , s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last several
months . unfortunately , this debate has generated more heat than light . we
want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis .
please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation
and our position on california energy issues .
what happened in california
the source of california  , s current problem is as straightforward as supply
and demand . california  , s economy grew 29 percent since 1998 . this increased
the demand for electricity by 24 percent . at the same time , regulatory
restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state . so
demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added . the result ,
predictably , is a shortage . this summer , peak capacity will be about 10
percent shy of peak demand , leading to further blackouts in the state .
in addition to the supply and demand imbalance , there are two other related
factors that led to the current crisis . first , the state  , s regulations
forced all sales and purchases into the spot market . the spot market for
power is extraordinarily volatile . the way firms behave in a free market
when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases long
term , medium term and short term , to reduce exposure to this volatility . in
california , state regulation prevented this strategy . this would be the
equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in the
most volatile interest rate environment imaginable . everything was fine
while the power surplus persisted , but when shortages ensued , every megawatt
was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price .
second , retail markets were not deregulated . regulated retail rates remained
in effect , and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep
competition out . this meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesale
prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the
regulated retail rate . they are now nearly bankrupt .
in short , california  , s problems were caused by regulation , not deregulation .
regulations prevented competitors from entering the market , prevented new
generation from being built , and prevented prudent hedging against volatile
spot prices .
at the time california was developing its restructuring plan , enron warned
the state  , s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives , which ,
if adopted , would have averted the current crisis .
enron  , s role
many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than fix
the problem . power sellers , including enron , have been vilified by the
politicians and the media . here are the facts :
? other than a small amount of wind power , enron is not a generator in the
state of california . every megawatt we sold in california we bought in the
same market available to other california purchasers . because we are a
market maker , not a generator , we are not biased toward high prices . we are
interested only in having a market that works so that we can package products
for our customers .
? as a seller to end - use markets in the state , we provided protection from
the problems the states  , utilities , and their customers , now face . we
protected , and still protect , our customers from price volatility .
you may have read that ees recently elected to have the utilities supply
power directly to its customers in california instead of procuring power on
the open market . early reports mischaracterized this as a  enron continues to sign up customers in the state ; and enron
continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in western
power markets . enron  , s primary business is managing risk for our customers
with solutions customized to meet their needs . there has never been more
demand for our products and services .
the solution
the solution to california  , s crisis is also straightforward . in summary , the
state must increase supply , reduce demand , reduce reliance on the spot market
and shore up the financial stability of the state  , s utilities .
increasing supply
california  , s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing
short of byzantine . enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in less
than a year . in california , it often takes 5 to 7 years . california simply
must streamline this process . ironically , while many of the regulations
generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality , the
regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and
displacing current plants , which emit 40 times as much nox . california can
have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new
facilities .
reducing demand
customers in california today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand .
they pay the same rate no matter what the market price is . an open retail
market would trigger demand responses , which would balance supply and demand
at lower prices than today . california should fully open its retail market .
reducing reliance on the spot market
in a truly deregulated market , customers would protect themselves from
volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer
term , fixed - price basis . the state has instead left procurement in the hands
of the utilities , which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market .
opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over their
price risk .
restoring the financial integrity of the state  , s institutions
the utilities in california are not paying their bills . this has led to
greater uncertainty in the market , higher costs , and reduced flexibility to
arrive at lasting solutions . california must permit its utilities to recover
their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and
distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is
needed .
just as important as doing these things , the state must avoid policies that ,
while politically attractive , do not fix the problem or even make matters
worse . price caps have been proposed . they don  , t work ; have never worked ;
and they will not work here . price caps succeed only in creating shortages ,
which then have to be allocated among competing users . imagine how
ineffectively the government would be in determining , for example , whether it
is better to make its limited power supplies available to the imperial valley
or silicon valley . price caps are a surefire way to make the current
shortage worse .
the state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in
california . there is no reason to believe , and every reason to doubt , that
the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in ,
constructing , operating and maintaining assets . this will also result in
california tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power
generation - - which the private sector can do - - instead of education , roads
and other public goods - - which the private sector cannot do .
as you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about the
crisis from the media , it  , s important for you to know this : we at enron will
continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real
solutions to the state .","Reply: Thank you for bringing this matter to our attention.

However, we can explore alternative arrangements for addressing the discrepancy in our records. To address this, could you please provide us with a detailed breakdown of the deal and any potential impact on our current pricing structure? Additionally, can you please provide us with the pricing structure for a specific day for which the volume was allocated to a specific deal?

i have reviewed the gas composition analysis from spl of the basin production
from ga 213 . while spl ' s analysis does show a dewpoint of around 20 degrees
f at 400 psig , it is both my and john handley ' s opinion that the gas from the
wellbore had stratified by the time that this sample was taken . we expect
the dewpoint of the flowing gas to be higher . however , this was the best
sample that could be obtained at the time . we have conferred with steve
schneider and we are willing to take this gas on a conditional basis over the
next couple of days . once the 6 "" line has been pigged , the production flows
stablilized and mitchell ' s conditioning equipment lined out over the next
couple of days , hms will need to take another sample at the meter run and
have spl run an extended analysis with a dewpoint curve on an expedited
basis . should this sample indicate a dewpoint over 45 degrees f , then this
production will be shut in again until hydrocarbon dewpoint conditioning
equipment has been installed . in the meantime , hms needs to keep a close
watch on all southern union city gates on galveston island to monitor for
liquids fallout .","ron north america corp .

Reply: Regarding your questions, I have gathered the following information:

1. Meter 9643 Hgpl - Stratton, Tejones Operating Corporation, Sitara 266970: Should this purchase be at meter 9638, Freeman Prod - Maxine Field in Trade Zone 18?
2. I assume that we are not counting both meters in question, but rather are focusing on two unrelated meters - Meter 9848 North padre Island blk 8 and Meter 9862 Lehman/Spinnaker onshore. In case of the mentioned gas, it is indeed the same gas. If this gas is indeed the same quantity, we should count both meters as equal.
3. Meter 3536 Seymour/A - S (Mat Plt 520) - EOG Resources, Sitara 725391: Is this purchase properly in the wellhead book?
4. Meter 3536 Seymour/A - S (Mat Plt 520) - EOG Resources, Sitara 725391: Is this purchase properly in the wellhead book?

5. Meter 6884 PGTT junction 16 "" lease , comstock oil & gas, inc . and Kerr - Mcgee Oil & Gas onshore L. P. & L. P., Sitara 125899 and 132975: Comstock's volume should exceed Kerr - Mcgee's volume. The discrepancy should be resolved by adding a different volume of approximately 73,000/day.

Please confirm if this gas is indeed a separate purchase or is in the wellhead book. Thank you for your cooperation.

0,"Subject: new enrononline functionality
the following additions and modifications to stack manager will be effective as of saturday september 8 , 2001 .
stack manager modifications
inactivate all stack - in addition to the individual activate / inactive stack buttons , there is now an inactivate all stack button . similar to the suspend all button , this button will inactivate the trader ' s stack on all active products . any existing top of stack limit orders will continue to post to the website and remain transactable . see screen shot below : inactivate all stack button on far right .
please note that we have switched the positions of the suspend and inactivate buttons in stack manager .
fill order - if a product is set up as either restricted top of stack or top of stack the trader now has the ability to automatically fill any order that is at the top of the stack . in order to fill a limit order that is at the top of the product ' s stack , which will appear in pink , the trader should right click anywhere on the stack window and choose "" fill order "" . the volume filled on an order will be that which is offered by the trader . in order to fill the complete volume of the order , the trader will need to adjust the volume in his stack .
floated stack windows - if the stack is inactive on a product , the price and volume fields on the my products tab will continue to be blank . on the depth window and floated stack window of these products the trader ' s prices will be in gray and italics . children of products that have inactive stacks will not be gray and italicised in the floated stack windows and will not see the calculated prices .
no auto inactivate stack - it is now possible to keep a product active even if the trader is not logged into stack manager . if the trader wishes to enable this functionality on the upper right corner of the product properties page the trader should choose "" no auto inactivate when stack manager is down "" .
changes regarding suspension of products
stack manager will inactivate products rather than suspend them in the following cases :
? market close - if a product is active at the end of its trading hours its stack will automatically become inactive rather than suspending . in order to keep a product ' s stack active past the set trading hours , the trader should choose "" keep awake "" next to the trading hours section of the product properties page .
? auto suspend now inactivates stack - on a product with the auto suspend function enabled to monitor the price changes on the product , the product ' s stack will be inactivated if the suspend at level is reached . this feature can be used by checking the enable box on the product properties page under the auto suspend section .
? logging out of stack manager - when you log out of stack manager without inactivating or suspending your products , the system will now inactivate your products rather than suspending them .
","Reply: Thank you for providing the information regarding stack manager functionality changes. We appreciate your efforts in updating our systems to better suit our needs. Please keep us updated on any necessary changes or enhancements that may be necessary to ensure seamless integration with our operations. Should you require further assistance or clarification, feel free to reach out. We look forward to working together on this project.

Reply Body: Dear Steve,

Thank you for bringing this to our attention. We are working towards ensuring the project progresses smoothly. We understand that there are various challenges that may arise from the current system, including the lack of transparency and accountability within our supply chain. To address these challenges, we will arrange a meeting with Darren Farmer to discuss the best course of action for this project. This will allow us to ensure a smooth transition and avoid any potential issues arising from the current situation. Please feel free to reach out with any additional questions or concerns.

i think we need to remove some of the demand charges that have been set up
for williams and apache . on williams deal 384237 , the demand charge needs to
be removed from sept . 2000 . the demand charge should not have started until
october 2000 . because we did not know at the time what was happening with
this deal , the demand fee was inadvertently paid to williams for sept . and we
need to recoup our money . on apache deal 384247 , james thinks we need to
remove the demand charge completely . he says it is not a part of the deal
and apache is not billing us for it . we also need to talk about the pricing
on both of these deals . williams and apache are billing us less than what we
have in sitara . to be able to keep this desk at zero , jim pond does not want
me to use pay the lesser of for the purchases , so we need to address the
price differences . you said you had some contract briefs that supported our
prices . please fax a copy to me at 713 - 646 - 8420 and i will compare them to
what james has .
just a heads up . . . we are beginning to work on november 2000 , so we will need
a demand fee entered ( hopefully next week ) . i will email you the spreadsheet
after we have received all of the cash and are ready to pay tenaska iv .
thanks ,
megan",".

Reply: Regarding your questions on removing demand charges for Williams and Apache, I believe that we should first address their billing discrepancies. The pricing on Williams deal 384237 is indeed a part of our agreement and we should consider a change in billing. Please fax the document to me as soon as possible to discuss these billing discrepancies.

To clarify the pricing structure on Apache deal 384247, James thinks that it is essential to balance billing discrepancies between both companies. He is working on resolving the billing issue from Sitara, but he is currently considering whether to proceed with billing the equivalent of the difference between the two amounts.

In regards to Apache's billing, we should also discuss the pricing for Sitara with Jim Pond. He is considering a different arrangement for this deal. To ensure a smooth resolution, I suggest we discuss this with him about the matter.

Regarding Apache's billing, we need to discuss it with Jim and ensure that the pricing is balanced between both parties. We also need to discuss the pricing for Sitara with you as well.

Please confirm if there are any other details that you believe would be beneficial to discuss with Jim. If not, we can proceed with the billing process accordingly.

Thank you for bringing this to our attention. Should you have any further questions or require clarification on these matters, feel free to reach out.

daren wanted me to make this request to you for an equistar buyback ticket
on enron north america { ena } .
equistar has nominated activity on ena for june and july 2000 production .
settlement seems to think a buyback ticket is necessary to properly account
for equistar ' s monthly activity .","Dear Team,

I have reviewed the Equistar ""Buyback"" ticket with ENA on June and July 2000 production. Settlement has made an assumption that a buyback ticket should be necessary to manage the monthly activities. This is incorrect. We need to ensure that all transactions are properly accounted for and addressed to the proper authorities.

To ensure accurate accounting, I have initiated a process for handling the purchaseback ticket with Equistar. The Sitara counterparty is responsible for handling this responsibility. If there are any discrepancies or concerns, please notify me immediately so we can address them promptly.

Please note that your team will continue working collaboratively to address these matters and ensure a smooth process for all parties involved. If you have any questions or require further assistance, feel free to contact me at [email address] or call (713) 853-7202.

Dear Team Members,

We would like to bring your attention to the recent organizational changes announced by Enron. The newly formed Global Strategic Sourcing Unit will focus on consolidating Enron's existing activities and expanding into new ventures. This new group will focus on aggregating Enron's core businesses, including gas, power, metals, and energy trading.

As part of this transition, the group will focus on enhancing operational efficiencies while expanding its international operations. This process will also involve the formation of a new global strategic sourcing unit focusing on commodity sourcing, global risk management, and operational risk management activities. This strategic move aligns with the ongoing growth and expansion of Enron's global operations, which will provide a strategic framework for future growth and success.

To better align these initiatives, we request that you kindly review the attached executive summary and any additional details related to the restructuring of the Global Strategic Sourcing Unit. These strategic changes will be implemented as planned and will be implemented in a seamless manner. Please feel free to reach out with any questions or concerns regarding these changes or their implementation.

gary called me about this shut in situation a few minutes ago , specifically
regarding meter 6722 . this meter is at the tailgate of three rivers ,
therefore , an hpl field employee will not be able to contact the producer
( they probably have no idea where the gas is coming from that goes through
this meter ) .
gary suggested that the deal maker contact these producers verbally , and then
connie sutton will follow up with written notice . per our discussion , since

Reply: Subject: Re: Producer Shut-in List for Victoria 18 "" Line Work

Dear George, Gary, and Jill,

I recently came across an issue with the producer shut-in list for Victoria 18's line work. The meter at tailgate of Three Rivers is at the end of the spectrum. Since there's no flow at this meter, it seems there could be a potential issue with the flow rate of the gas flowing at that meter. As a workaround, I have forwarded the information to Gary. Please review and provide any additional information that would help us resolve this situation.

In the meantime, kindly let me know if there are any other suitable alternatives you believe would be more efficient for this meter. I look forward to working together on addressing this issue.

Reply: Regarding the first delivery, please confirm if it is the same well nominated during Bidweek. If it is, then we need to adjust the price to Gd as per your suggestion. If it's a new well behind the meter, you can either create a new deal ticket for it or create a pricing tier on the old ticket. This way, we can adjust the old deal ticket to compensate for any discrepancies. If it is a new well behind the meter, you can either create a new deal ticket for it or create a new rate for it.

i have terminated about 12 to 13 inactive inter pipe / internal pools effective 12 / 01 / 01 . there are several other inactive pools which i did not eliminate because
they had balances in it .
i also spoke to jim tobacco at epgt for at least an hour or so , going over every line item which was rejected , please get with me once you are back in the office
and i will go over the "" correct "" pathing procedures .
i met with richard and reviewed november transactions for epgt to determine if we could eliminate the external pools but unfortunately we cannot do this .
if we transport then we must use the external pool . however , you do not need to use internal pools but must use the imbalance pools which you are currently
using , therefore , i have terminated the internal pools .
please review the changes and let me know if this will work for you . .
i will be in touch with you after i meet with el paso .","Regarding your concerns about EPGT termination, I've reviewed the situation and believe that there is no need for us to implement any measures unless there are internal pools that could be utilized. To ensure compliance with the policy, I will coordinate with Richard and discuss the appropriate actions. If you prefer to handle the internal pools, you will need to use the imbalance pools. In the meantime, you may not need to use internal pools if you plan to transport other than the external ones.

Regarding your questions about EPGT's internal pools, I have also reviewed November transactions for EPGT to determine if there's a need for implementing these changes. Although we cannot transfer them, we must still use the external pools for transactions. If you have any queries, feel free to reach out to me at extension 3-420014.

this well is behind the big cowboy system . at this time , we have deal ticket
380710 , purchase from ccgm , l . p . on hplc / hplc . this deal should probably be
on gulf energy / bigcowboy . the producer , as i understand it , is acock

shed on this deal would be very welcome , i would like to capture this

changing counterparty names on sitara deal tickets has absolutely no impact
to any downstream processes .
i hope the following will give more clarification .
let me know if you have any questions or need more detail !
thanks ,
dg 3 - 9517
sitara / unify - process
* scenario - counterparty name changes on sitara deal ticket after deal had
been pathed , scheduled & bridged back from unify .
* impact - zero impact to logistics & volume management , absolutely
harmless . settlements has process in place to eliminate issues .
* process -
counterparty a in sitara changes to counterparty b .
ctprty a was on original path sent to pipeline .
the new name ( ctprty b ) does bridge over to unify .
ctprty a remains at the path level in unify ( gui display does not change )
ctprty b is now displayed at the deal level in unify . the field is now
highlighted to indicate a change occurred . ( gui display changes only at high
level , not on path )
the scheduler has choice to repath ( if necessary ) , or not re - path
if re - pathing occurs , the new counterparty name will be displaced on new path
unify pushes back the deal number & meter to sitara ( not ctprty info )
balancing works on deal number & meter only ( not ctprty info )
the confirmation desk utilizes the information in sitara ( where all
information is correct )
volume management utilizes the information in unify for pipeline tie - out .
( all information sent to pipeline is correct at the path level and will match
up perfectly )
settlements utilizes information in unify .
settlements recognizes that changed ctprty names changes contracts , which
would create two notification entries
if invoice did happen to go out to wrong ctprty , re - draft would occur .
( note : there was an issues discovered on reports which it is correcting now )
autonoms "" tom ' s words of warning "" -
previously there was an issue when counterparty name changes took place after
deals were pathed and nominated . basically it would change a key on an edi
path ( duns number ) not affecting any other of the information already
nominated to the pipeline . if the scheduler re - nominated , data at the
pipeline would get doubled up and the scheduler would have no way to correct
the problem . in most cases , the schedulers would have to get the pipeline to
manually cut the original nominated volume . this is not an issue with unify
( as explained above ) .

subject : re : sitara release ( re : changes in global due to consent to
assignment )
fyi . . . .
this change went in for the deal validation group . it gives them the
ability to change counterparties names after bridge back .
impact to logistics - unify
if a counterparty name change takes place to deals that have been bridge
backed , it could cause problems on edi pipes as that new counterparty name
will flow over to unify and repathing should eventually take place .
one problem may be with the imbalance data sets , which are not in production
yet . . . . . . ( edi imbalance qtys would not match up to paths )
this may also cause an issue with the scheduled quantities ( especially where
nominations were sent for entire month )
can ' t remember the rules on this one , but i think unify does have some safe
guards ( idiot proofs ) to force re - pathing .
unify does have the ability to over - ride duns numbers , yet would still cause
an additional step for edi the scheduler would need to think through in order
to get a clean quick response .
what are ( if any ) impacts to vol mgt if counterparty name changes take
place ? ( prior periods ? re - pathing ? )
i have a call into diane and dave both . after speaking w / them , hopefully i
can get a clear understanding of the true impact . i am sure we ' ll need to
put some processes and procedures together for deal validation to follow when
these type of changes are needed .
will keep you posted .
thanks ,

subject : sitara release ( re : changes in global due to consent to assignment )
regarding the ability to change counterparties on deals in sitara with
confirmed volumes - tom ' s words of caution :
if someone calls you and wants to change a counterparty - we created the
ability for you to invalidate the deal - and
then change the counterparty - however - i did add a warning message :
"" warning - changing counterparty on deal with confirmed volumes - make sure
pipeline allows this change . ""
some pipelines do not allow us to change counterparties after there is
feedback - i assume for the same reasons
we had this rule - it used to blow up our old scheduling systems
( pre - unify ) . some pipelines will require a new
deal and we will have to zero out the old deal .
before you make the change - make sure the logistics person is aware - just
in case it causes problems with their
pipeline . sorry - i don ' t know which pipes these are - you will have to ask
the unify team .
there is one rule still in place - you can change from ena - im east to ena - im
market east - but not from
ena - im texas to hplc - im hplc - when changing business units - they must be
the same legal entity .
"" warning - not the same legal entity ""
also - beware of making contract and counterparty changes to service deals
( transport capacity , storage , cash out ) .
once the deal is invalidated - there are no rules . don ' t forget - the items
were locked down for a reason .
if you invalidate a service deal - and change the previously locked down
data that was validated - and someone used these
deals in unify - it is highly likely that the unify deals and paths created
using these deals will get corrupted . always check
with someone from unify to make sure no one used these deals for anything in
unify .

subject : sitara release ( re : changes in global due to consent to assignment )
with the release that was put out tuesday evening , deal validation should be
able to change the counterparty on deals where the volume is something other
than expected ( e . g . confirmed , nominated , scheduled , etc . ) .
in addition , this release will also capture "" near - time "" the contract changes
that are made in global . this means that need for server bounces will not be
necessary .
new / changes to contracts will show up without having to get out of deal
manager .
new counterparties , and new / changes to facilities will require getting out
of all active sitara apps ( except for launch pad ) .
once out of all apps , start a new app - the respective information that you
are looking for will appear .
i mention "" near - time "" because we are constrained by the amount of time it
takes for the change in global data to trigger an alert for sitara who then
updates its information

Reply: Subject: Re: Meter 9707 Update

Regarding the meter 9707 situation, Vance, I have not received any updates on this matter. However, I have looked into it and found out that there was a deal in place with United Oil & Minerals that required a meter for September. However, there seems to be no flow at the meter at that time. Vance mentioned that there was a deal in place with them in September 2000 for purchase from United Oil & Minerals, but I don't know if there was a deal in place. If there is a deal in place, it would be accurate and not required for September 2000. Please let me know if there is any further information required or if there are any specific questions. Thank you for bringing this to our attention, and let me know if there is anything else we can assist with.

Dear Daren,

I have been informed about the meter flow issue with Meter 98-1534. I have reviewed the details provided in Sitara Deal (151694), and I believe the deal should be extended through February 1st, 2000. If possible, could you please extend it for a specific deal date of January 31st, 2000, with a daily flow of 24 dec? This will help maintain the flow and minimize any potential issues related to Sitara's deal with Sitara.

stacy ,
could we add the following phrase ( as shown below in red ) to the exxon katy location ? this is to reassure our customers that the delivery is in fact intrastate . please let me know if this is possible to do and if we have your approval .
exxonkaty
the transaction is for delivery of intrastate gas at the tailgate of the exxon katy plant . notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the general terms and conditions , if applicable , this transaction is between counterparty and enron north america corp .

lisa ,
what is involved in changing a product description to include this phrase ? i do have some customers in texas that are legally bound to only trade intrastate gas and they are fearful of trading anything that doesn ' t specifically state that .
since it is probably only a handful of customers , if it is a major production , it may not be worth it , but i wanted to check .

hi daren ,
bryan hull gave me your name . a customer was interested in trading intrastate gas and bryan had informed me that our exxon - katy location is intrastate . i was wondering if you would be interested in changing the long description on eol for this location to include the phrase intrastate gas so that any customers that are interested would be able to see that . if this is okay with you , i will forward it on to our product development team .

Reply: Subject: Clarification on Intrastate Gas Issue

Melba,

Regarding your previous email about the intrastate gas issue, I believe that the language in question is not clear, especially since Jeff Hodge and Gerald Nemec have not responded to it. I will work with Jeff Hodge and Gerald to find the best solution that addresses this issue and aligns with our company policies and procedures. Please let me know if you require any further information on this matter.

sandi ,
sorry for just now getting back with you . i was out last week .
the rate ( $ . 04 / mmbtu ) will be charged on the greater of the volumes nominated
on the supply contracts or the actual deliveries to the plant . the fee will
be adjusted yearly based on cpi .
bob - i could not remember if we stated the type of settlement on the
delivered volumes ( actuals or nominations ) . i think we should use actuals
due to possibility that the plant could over pull with out our knowledge on a
daily basis . we would receive the estimates / actuals on a lag and may have to
purchase gas to offset the imbalance , even though the plant kept the noms at
the 45 , 000 base . i also think that if the plant does increase the nom , they
are more likely to pull the additional volume rather than pulling less . do
you agree with this ?

Reply: Subject: Re: New EOL Product

Regarding the Texas Gas Group's plans to roll out a ""super peak"" product for gas delivery from 1300 to 2100 CDT, it seems that they will need to update their pricing information to reflect this change. We will keep you updated on their progress.

Regarding the pricing for ""peak"" 5x8 product (900 to 2100 CDT), we will keep you informed about this matter as it progresses. We will also share the prices with you as they become available. Once again, thank you for your cooperation in this matter.

As for the ""general terms and conditions"" ability to handle intra-day nominations, it's essential to note that we currently trade this product with an average of 10,000 daily.

As for the ""general terms and conditions"" ability to handle intra-day nominations, it would be beneficial to have a separate contract for this product type. This would allow us to manage its impact on our operations effectively without requiring any additional expenses.

hplc continues to purchase gas from both ocean and seneca on a term basis ; firm tickets were submitted for april origination beginning with the month of april . as for as barrett , they are selling their gas under a joa with seneca ; therefore , 100 % of barrett ' s production is being paid to seneca . consequently , you should see tickets in sitara for both counterparties .

jackie ,
what does mops show for the days in question ? it would be incorrect to add
any days to the adonis ticket mentioned below . it sounds as if the meter was
allocated incorrectly in pops and / or a deal was not pathed correctly in
mops . let me know what you find in mops .

here is the issue for 1 / 16 / 99 at meter 984132 .
20 , 000 mmbtu were confirmed for adonis in pops . 10 , 000 mmbtu on day 5 and
day 16 . day 16 is not valid for deal 51862 ( track id 6155 ) , which is where
10 , 000 was confirmed . the actual sale to adonis was 10 , 000 which was
invoiced and paid by adonis . we are trying to clear the feedback error
report . my question is why was 10 , 000 confirmed on 1 / 16 / 99 if the date is
not valid for the deal ?
when karen allocates the actual 10 , 000 it is prorating 5 , 000 for each day
that is confirmed ( the 5 th and 16 th ) .
should the whole 10 , 000 be allocated to the 5 th or should 5 , 000 be allocated
to each day ? if 5 , 000 should be allocated to each day , the 16 th needs to be
added to the deal .","farmer / hou / ect on 08 / 23 / 2000 12 : 59 pm - - - - - 

Reply: Regarding Meter 984132 for 1/16/99, it appears there's no deal in place at this time. The deal in question seems to be the ""allocated"" meter mentioned by Jackie Young from the pops desk. The deal on Day 16 in MOPS seems to be an allocation of 10.0 pathed to ENA. The deal on Day 16 in MOPS seems to be related to a swing deal with an allocation of a specific date. If you have any further questions or need clarification on this matter, please feel free to reach out. Thank you for bringing this to my attention.

Regarding Fred's concern regarding meter 5688, I have gathered some information regarding the meters and their status. It seems there may be some confusion regarding their current status as well. To address this, I have gathered relevant data from the above meter, including current volumes, as well as relevant information from the HPL liquids contract, which should be treated as a separate concern.

In the case of Meter 5688, it appears that it was incorrectly scheduled for the HPL liquids contract on February 4, 2000, with the HPL liquids contract being the one that expired on March 4, 2000. The current situation is that Meter 5688 is scheduled to go through King Ranch as mentioned in your email. Please kindly confirm if there is any reason for this change. We look forward to providing you with the necessary information.

Best regards,
Daren,

thanks , clem","Dear Clem,

Thank you for bringing this matter to our attention. We have reviewed the meter details for deal #124400 and discussed the situation with the relevant parties. For deal ticket #124400, it appears that the gas loss associated with this meter was recorded on November 30th, 1999. However, since Deal #124400 has expired on November 30th, it may be possible to write-off this loss as unaccounted for gas loss, as per your request.

To resolve this issue, please provide us with a clear explanation on the nature of the deal, the dates and their significance, and the necessary approvals to execute it. Additionally, kindly provide the relevant details about the specific deal or associated deal ticket number. We will then proceed accordingly and ensure proper record-keeping and accurate accounting for all volumes.

We appreciate your cooperation in ensuring that we are providing accurate information on all relevant transactions. Please feel free to contact us should you require any assistance or have further questions regarding this matter.

Reply: Subject: Re: Meter #1266 - August 2000/Agency Exception - Clarification

Regarding the meter allocation exceptions mentioned, Conoco has nominated 5.0/d at this meter, which corresponds to their allocation. However, their transport can be used for all days within this time frame as long as they are the only party handling business at the meter. Consequently, HPL may also be able to extract a sale from the overage for this overage, which is why I wanted you to be aware of it.

just so you know , this is what i sent redmond about that 311 case .
- - - - - original message - - - - -
from : hull , bryan
sent : tuesday , august 14 , 2001 7 : 16 am
to : redmond , brian
subject : fw : section 311
brian , this is a pretty good explanation of the case thus far . . . . . .
commissioner wood is aware of the conflict between pg & e ( now epgt ) and southern union , probably because of lobbying by southern union , and that is why he raised the issue . southern union states in its initial brief ( # 9 below ) that it opposes the high demand rates that it says epgt proposes to charge for a service that does not incorporate the consumer protections of order no . 636 and argues that ferc should impose order no . 636 standards on pg & e . i was watching a video stream of the meeting , and the whole discussion seemed to come out of nowhere .
here are the facts in this case .
1 ) on december 20 , 1999 , pg & e texas pipeline , lp ( the predecessor to epgt texas pipeline , lp ) filed a petition with ferc for approval of transportation rates under section 311 along , as they were required to do . ( all intrastate pipelines that perform section 311 service must either have their rates approved by ferc or they must charge rates that are approved by a state regulatory body for a similar service . ) pg & e ' s filing proposed , in addition to the usual interruptible service , a firm section 311 service as well as an interruptible parking and lending service . pg & e also filed a revised statement of operating conditions to reflect the new services .
2 ) on february 25 , 2000 , southern union gas company , an intrastate transportation customer of pg & e , filed a late motion to intervene and raised issues which it stated should be addressed in a hearing . pg & e opposed the late intervention , but ferc granted it on april 14 , 2000 . ( pg & e stated that southern union was intervening in order to gain leverage in renegotiating its contract for intrastate service . )
3 ) southern union submitted data requests to pg & e on april 13 and april 17 . pg & e attempted to get a protective order issued , but ferc rejected their request .
4 ) a settlement conference was held on september 7 , 2000 .
5 ) a staff panel was convened on october 2 , 2000 , in order to conduct an advisory , non - evidentiary proceeding for oral arguments on the issues , with instructions to make recommendations to the commission within 90 days .
6 ) on november 1 , 2000 , ferc requested 5 pages of additional information from pg & e in order to complete the application in the proceeding , which pg & e provided on november 8 th . on december 8 th , pg & e provided additional information in response to a ferc data request .
7 ) on january 10 , 2001 , southern union submitted a proposed alternative to the cost of service and rate design that was filed by pg & e .
8 ) on january 17 , el paso field services informed ferc that pg & e texas pipeline , lp had been acquired by el paso on december 22 , 2000 , and that the name was changed to epgt texas pipeline , lp .
9 ) on january 24 , 2001 , epgt texas and southern union filed initial briefs .
10 ) on july 17 , 2001 , epgt filed supplemental comments in response to the discussion at ferc summarized below , where commissioner wood inquired about the extension of some order no . 636 and 637 provisions to section 311 service providers . epgt stated that , if ferc proceeds with this policy , it should do so in a generic rulemaking and not in an individual pipeline proceeding . on july 30 , 2001 , southern union filed reply comments opposing epgt ' s supplemental comments .
11 ) on august 3 , epgt filed an amended statement of operating conditions , which provides for electronic nominations , two additional nomination cycles , bumping , clarified and updated credit provisions , modified quality provisions to protect system integrity , and more clearly defined authorized overrun service .
the ngpa gives ferc authority over intrastate pipeline rates for section 311 service and requires that such service be provided on a non - discriminatory basis , but there is some question as to whether it gives ferc authority to require , for example , compliance with order nos . 636 and 637 .
please let me know if this is enough detail ( or maybe it ' s more than you wanted ! ! ) .","( the company that d

Reply: Reply Body: Thank you for sharing your thoughts on this matter. While it seems like an important topic, we should not forget that the actions we take and the actions we take are crucial for maintaining a strong faith in God. While it may seem like a personal choice, we should also consider the impact on others. Let's focus on maintaining a positive outlook and making our decisions with faith. We can discuss these topics in our upcoming correspondence. Let's work together to make a positive impact for all involved. Best regards.

The deal was indeed for days 25 & 26 to $5.285, and the deal ticket #690249 was for days 25 & 26 to $5.285, but there were no deals for those days on those days as per the information provided earlier.

Reply: Regarding your query on physical storage, we don't have any physical storage on PG&E. However, it seems that PG&E has a significant amount of physical storage in their database, and that they have an ongoing project underway on the storage for their storage in Sitara. As of now, there are no specific storage locations mentioned in their information. As for the mentioned project, we are still awaiting their reply regarding the storage requirements. We will keep you updated on any progress or developments related to this matter as soon as possible. Thank you for your cooperation.

dear dave,

I just wanted to confirm that spindletop and bammel are indeed on the same page regarding the storage arrangement for their respective projects. Spindletop's project involves a deal with a deal with PG&E with their purchase of the Bammel storage. In addition to this, they are working on their own storage solutions for Bammel and their purchase of the Spindletop storage.

Regarding our discussion on spindletop and Bammel, we are currently working on the storage arrangements for their projects, as well as their purchases of Bammel. As per our conversation, we are prioritizing projects related to their projects and will keep you informed as more information becomes available.

For November, we have two firm sales for $199 per day and $199 at 10th-13th days. The first sale is priced at $0.05 with a spot price of $25k on Tuesdays, while the second sale is priced at $0.12 at 12th-13th days.

Dear Elizabeth,

Thank you for bringing this matter to our attention. I have reviewed deal 70120 for the volume of 25,000 MMBTU/d of HPL gas delivered on May 1st, 2001. The contract is currently in place with D&H Gas Company to cover the remaining volume. I have discussed this with our team and will ensure it is extended to cover the necessary amount in case of any unforeseen circumstances. We are committed to ensuring the necessary adjustments are made to the deal.

Please let me know if you have any further queries or concerns regarding this matter. We value your cooperation in maintaining a smooth business relationship and are committed to ensuring a smooth transition for all parties involved.

for prior periods - i am not sure if you need to handle this using the
instructions below - or if for prior months only - if you would be allowed
to create a
cashout ticket to clear out any prior period imbalances . your controller
and volume management ( kathy kelly ) should make this call .
kim and david can brain check me on this - but i think this is how parking
should be done ; however ,
please verify with west or east desk economics to ensure accuracy / consistency .
parking procedures
create a storage deal in sitara - service type : parking
use this service deal to path to a storage account in unify - this way you
have accounted for the gas in unify
inject into storage account
withdrawal from storage account
( when you do the opposite of parking - withdrawal first - it is called a
"" loan "" )
create two economic deals in sitara - exchange deal
create an internal buy and sell of physical gas for economics and position
purposes - ( no invoices - fake 3 rd party )
exchange deal -
sell to cpr pipeline exchange ( parking gas )
buy from cpr pipeline exchange ( getting gas back )
within the month parking - no money exchanges hands - except any service fees
which can be recorded on the storage deal .
sell to cpr pipeline exchange ( parking gas ) - price = $ 0
buy from cpr pipeline exchange ( getting gas back ) price = $ 0
when the deal crosses a month - if you keep the risk within the desk - in the
short term you record a big loss - sell at $ 0 - and the
next month you record a big gain - buy at $ 0 . to manage this - usually the
cash desk swaps out the time risk to a storage financial book - who will pick
up the time
spread loss and offsetting gain - as this book captures forward value .
when you are adjusting your physical injections ( parking ) within the month -
you will need to
adjust your swaps too - which will adjust the p & l for the time spread
accordingly - otherwise you will have liquidation problems .
period 1 - sell to cpr pipeline exchange ( parking gas ) - price = $ 0 swap
to firm book for index + mid
period 2 - buy from cpr pipeline exchange ( getting gas back ) price = $ 0
swap to firm book for index + mid","Reply: Regarding your request for creating a cashout ticket, please note that the controller and volume management (Kate Kelly) should handle this responsibility.

we are not receiving timely information from the hub regarding our park and lend agreement . i have not received an update since tues or wed of last week . mike has been phoning them furiously for information and has been told that they don ' t have it , or it will be ready later . per gisb , final scheduled numbers on epng , nng , and tw are reported at 9 : 00 am the following day ( ie . sunday final will be out at 9 am on mon . ) . prior to the transition from pg & e , we received our balance by 9 : 15 or 9 : 30 am . i realize that the transition has been difficult , they are never a cake walk , however , this type of information is crucial . further , they have not provided any final numbers for the month of april , we should at least be able to receive a "" best available "" number , and the interstate pipes , due to gisb , have final scheduled numbers available on the first of the month . i submit that ena should not be held liable for payment of the $ 0 . 03 / day rate , as we have not received the information we need to balance the agreement . if epgt plans to administer fees , then balance information should be communicated on a timely basis . we may want to check the terms of the agreement , and / or negotiate a reduced rate for the month of may .
thank you ,

Reply: Regarding your email, I understand that the hub park and lend agreement is not yet receiving timely updates. Mike has been keeping an open line of communication for this matter, as he has been repeatedly asking for accurate information. In regards to the payment of the $0.03/day rate, it seems that the interstate pipes have not been provided with the necessary information, as we lack the required information for a ""best available"" rate.

With regard to the current situation with PG&E's payment of $0.03/day rate, it appears that we are awaiting final numbers from ENA and should have them by 9:00 AM on Monday. The actual payment may take longer due to a change in billing status, which could impact our ability to meet the deadline. Our goal is to submit a ""best available"" rate for April, and we will keep you updated on that status as soon as possible. Please feel free to reach out with any further questions or concerns. Thank you for your patience and understanding.

Reply: Subject: Tenaska IV Outage Update

Regarding the Tenaska IV outage update, I have confirmed that the Cleburne plant will resume operations on Monday, October 7th. The schedule has already been submitted to Lonestar for the weekend (7th-9th) with all gas to the plant. If they come up early, we have a potential imbalance gas issue that will serve them. I have informed Mary about this, and will provide her with a copy of the nominations, #'s and contacts, etc.

As per Mark McCoy's request, I will forward the updated information to her on October 5th. As for the outage, she will receive the gas from Lonestar on Monday. We will update you on any further developments as they become available. Thank you for your cooperation.

Thank you for bringing this matter to our attention. I have reviewed the gas consumption details from December 29th, and it appears to be a significant issue with Elsa's meter 74. The 12,200 unit from Transco was cut due to pipeline capacity constraints and has been taken to a different location. We will investigate this further and address any concerns related to gas usage and possible impacts on your system.

Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any additional queries or require additional information. We value your business and look forward to working together towards resolving this issue.

Reply: Regarding the concern about Phenylpropanolamine, we appreciate your concern regarding potential exposure. Although we do not currently possess any alkaseltzer within our stores, we would be grateful if you could confirm if there are any other suitable sources of alkaseltzer in our environment. This will help us ensure that our customers are aware of their health risks and remain safe from potential exposure. Kindly keep us updated on any developments or additional information related to this subject. Thank you for your continued cooperation.

meter 098 - 4179 , goliad co . , tx
in regards to meter 098 - 4179 the following information is what i have been
able to determine from the information available to me .
to your questions :
1 . cannot determine who owns this meter . i will contact molly carriere on
monday when she returns .
2 . hpl has a fifty ( 50 ) ft . easement at this location which does contain
language for appurtenance rights within the 50 ' .
3 . i pulled the meter file for this location which was prepared during
project rock and it does not contain a facility agreement so i am assuming
one was not located .
hope this helps .

attached is a contract preparation request for a facilities agreement for the
coastal oil the
legal department has prepared and is currently circulating a ratification and

we have been unable to locate an existing facility agreement for the 3
previously drilled wells and suspect that no such agreement exists .
the facility agreement requested herein is intended to cover only alterations
to be made to existing meter 098 - 4179 to install an h 2 s monitor and necessary
valving to allow hplc to accept gas from the newly drilled albrecht # 4 well .
once the h 2 s monitor has been installed and the albrecht # 4 well is ready to
flow , we intend to paper the purchase of gas from the albrecht # 4 well only
via a spot confirmation pursuant to a spot gtc . the albrecht # 4 will not be
covered by 96008903 , nor will the wells currently subject to 96008903 be
subject to the spot gtc .
coastal will reimburse hplc $ 39 , 600 for the cost of the installation .

the newly drilled coastal oil in may , 2000 , the meter flowed about 960
mmbtu / d of 3 . 36 % co 2 gas .
the content of the albrecht # 4 gas according to the field gas analysis
prepared by coastal oil the albrecht # 4 h 2 s content
is similar to that of the three wells currently producing 960 mmbtu / d behind
meter 098 - 4179 , the miller - albrecht unit # 1 - a and the hoff heller gas unit
# 1 a & # 2 d . coastal further purports that for some time now it ( and / or its
predecessor , mjg , corp . ) has treated these three wells for h 2 s in a manner
sufficient to reduce the h 2 s content delivered into hplc to permissible
levels . coastal has further indicated that it intends to reduce the h 2 s
content of the albrecht # 4 to permissible levels before delivering same to
hplc . in your opinion , should coastal be forced to install an h 2 s monitor
for this new gas prior to flowing same to hplc ?

Reply: Regarding your query about the June 1999 date and its relation to June of 1999, I believe the correct date should be June of 1999. This is consistent with our records and reflects the initial discussion we had with the East Desk on June 4th, 1999. We had a meeting with them on that date, but it appears that they had a different agenda. It's possible that they had a different agenda for June of 1999, but our records show it was at their location.

For June 1999, our records show that we did not receive any nominations from ENRON North America Corp. at that time. The specific deal number is 6/4/99. We have not received any nominations for this specific deal from them.

As for June 1999, we were processing the gas at the East Desk on June 4th, 1999. Please confirm if this is accurate and provide a record of the specific date. If so, we can proceed accordingly. We will then proceed with processing the gas as planned.

Kindly let me know if you have any additional questions or require additional information. Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

what does mops show for the days in question ? it would be incorrect to add
any days to the adonis ticket mentioned below . it sounds as if the meter was

20 , 000 mmbtu were confirmed for adonis in pops . 10 , 000 mmbtu on day 5 and
day 16 . day 16 is not valid for deal 51862 ( track id 6155 ) , which is where
10 , 000 was confirmed . the actual sale to adonis was 10 , 000 which was
invoiced and paid by adonis . we are trying to clear the feedback error
report . my question is why was 10 , 000 confirmed on 1 / 16 / 99 if the date is
not valid for the deal ?
when karen allocates the actual 10 , 000 it is prorating 5 , 000 for each day
that is confirmed ( the 5 th and 16 th ) .
should the whole 10 , 000 be allocated to the 5 th or should 5 , 000 be allocated
to each day ? if 5 , 000 should be allocated to each day , the 16 th needs to be
added to the deal .","5 in mops ( hpl / ena )

the only valid "" buyback "" ticket for meter # : 1373 is sitara ticket # :
246408 . s . ticket # : 156342 is an old ticket which was used to set up
buyback
ticket across equistar ' s meters { 1552 , 1384 , 1062 , 1553 } . if you recall
this process was done to enable client services to automate equistar

since equistar has begun doing business via ena , it was necessary to

robert ,
there are three buy back tickets in sitara for equistar at mtr 1373 . two for
hpl and one under ena . shouldn ' t we have only one buyback for each company ?
also , how do you have the meter set up to allocate between the ena contract
and hpl contract ?
d","Reply: Regarding the Equistar buybacks ticket for Meter #1373, I understand that there may be a need for a separate ticket for Sitara ticket #246408. This ticket involves the old ""buyback"" process related to Meter #1373. To ensure a seamless flow of gas, we will need to establish a separate ""buyback"" ticket for Meter #1373 on HPL and ENA. As per your email, it is essential to ensure that this system is connected to the ENA activity to maintain efficient operations and efficiency.

As for the ENA activity, please note that the swing is allocated to HPL and ENA's production line. The swing is allocated to ENA only during the month of April 2000, while the swing is actually for both HPL and ENA. If you need further clarification on this, feel free to contact me.

Regarding the ""buyback"" ticket for Meter #1373, it seems to be an older one. It was created in April 2000, but it was not designed for automation purposes. If you need any clarification or have any questions about this particular deal, please do not hesitate to reach out. Thank you for your cooperation.

reported in the prior period . for instance , if you reported vacation time for
the july lst - 15 th pay period , it will be reflected on your july 31 st pay
advice as  + pvacation  , .

of as a credit in the deduction section . the various benefit deductions will
remain itemized in the deduction section .

pay advice throughout the year . ( note that your w 2 at the end of the year
will reflect your earnings by company ) .

my paycheck has a line called  & other deductions  8 , what does that stand for ?
there is a fixed amount of lines to print deductions on the paycheck . for
some employees , the number of deductions are more than we have room to
print . in this circumstance , the system totals all remaining deductions and
prints them on one line  ) titled  & other deductions  8 . the detail of all
deductions can be viewed on the pay advice that is displayed on the intranet

these definitions are listed on the payroll webpage located at
hrweb . enron . com , select enron payroll from the side index .
why is my overtime not reflected on my paycheck ?
overtime is paid one pay period in arrears , therefore it will be reflected in
the next pay period . for example , if you reported overtime for the
july lst  ) 15 th pay period , it will be reflected on your july 31 st pay advice
as  + povertime  , .

for year 2000 the limit is $ 4 , 724 . 40 on a wage base of $ 76 , 200 . this limit is

another enron company these limits will start over , however , the total amount
withheld across all companies will be reflected on your paystub . excess fica
will be credited to you by the irs via your tax return .
what federal income tax rate is used for my bonus or when i exercise stock
options ?
there is a standard federal income tax rate of 28 % for these earnings . this
can be higher if the employee has completed a supplemental tax form
requesting a higher rate ( this form can be found at hrweb . enron . com , select
enron payroll from the side index ) .","Reply: Thank you for sharing the new payroll information. We appreciate your efforts in keeping us updated on these changes. To ensure seamless communication, please follow these steps:

why are we re - allocating prior month volumes at enerfin after we matched your

process ?
the numbers for october between ena - tetco and hpl vary a good bit . are we
your only customer at that point and why do we show volumes on days ena had
no transactions with hpl ? can we simply put zero paths in unify and extend
our existing deals in sitara with zero volumes and have you guys actualize

subject : re : hpl discrepancy
victor ,
the sitara ticket that we were using for the month of october is # 421415 .
tetco shows that the volumes that hpl was allocated on october 6 th and
october 19 th , were 9 dths and 44 dths , respectively . those volumes were
pulled off of our backhaul contract because there was no nomination in
place . this is the same problem that we have had over and over with them .
also , we just found out on tuesday , that the oba did not go into effect until
december 1 , 2000 . we were originally told that they were putting the oba in
effect retroactively to november of 1999 . in fact , i thought that hpl had
made a lot of retroactive changes in the system to adjust for the oba , do you
remember that ? hpl told us that ray calles at tetco is the one who decided
that the oba would not be effective until december of 2000 . nobody even
informed us of this change , i stumbled upon it when researching a november
issue for alfonso trabulsi and brenda fletcher . in addition to all of this ,
i received another email , which i will copy below , asking me to go in for the
month of october and adjust all of my estimated volumes in unify to match
what hpl shows that we were allocated . i had been going in all month long
and matching to their numbers , and we were clean for the deadline at the end
of the month . i ran the allocation report from tetco for the month of
october , and some of hpl ' s numbers were very different from tetco ' s ,
including the two days that i mentioned above . i sent jackie young an email
back showing her tetco ' s numbers and i haven ' t received a response . i will
copy that email below as well , just to catch you up on what ' s been going on .

subject : october volumes
hi jackie ,
i ran a report from tetco ' s system to show the volumes that enron was
allocated for the month of october , and some of the volumes are very
different from the volumes that you show . i copied your numbers below and
copied tetco ' s volumes below that ( with the disrepancies in red ) . i was
wondering if you could double check the 3 rd , 4 th , 11 th , 12 th , 25 th , and 27 th
to see if you had purchases on those days from a counterparty other than
enron north america at that meter . it looks like maybe the volumes that you
show are the total flow at that meter , but i think that only part of the gas
was actually allocated to us . i don ' t mind putting the allocated volumes in
path manager , but i ' d like to make sure that on the above days , i am only
putting in the amount that enron was allocated .
also , on the 6 th and the 19 th tetco shows exactly half of what you show ,
which i thought was kind of strange . i am going to have to get tetco ' s
permission to do a retroactive nomination for those two days at the volumes
you have requested , before i can put anything in sitara or unify . my manager
is out of the office and will be back tomorrow , but i would like for him to
double check the deal that we will have to create in sitara for those two
days , since we are dealing with a prior month issue .

Reply: Subject: Re: HPL discrepancy

Thank you for bringing this to our attention. I have reviewed the situation regarding the HPL discrepancy with Enerfin and found that the discrepancies appear to be unrelated to our intended purpose. To resolve this issue, I have requested clarification on the allocation process and potential consequences. To address your query, I will follow up with you to clarify the issue.

Firstly, please confirm if you are the only customer at the time of the discrepancy and if there is a need for us to re-allocate prior month volumes after matching your original numbers back in October? We need to ensure that the volumes are accurately reflected in Unify and maintain proper accounting practices. Secondly, please provide the reason behind the discrepancies for which they were discovered. If you believe there might be an underlying cause or concern, please provide the details on how these numbers were allocated and how they relate to your business needs.

Lastly, I will request further clarification on the allocation of zero paths for the specific deals in Sitara with zero volumes and a corresponding zero path for the entire month. If you have any additional questions or need further clarification, feel free to contact me at your convenience.

Kind regards,
Rita.

Regarding the prior month misnomination issue, I have reviewed Deal #237415's nomination with 6,400 MMBTU from Transwestern to Oasis #6301. It appears to be incorrect since the deal ticket was initially from Northern to Oasis, Karen Lindely & our paper nominations were incorrectly handled. To correct this issue, kindly update the ticket with proper details and accurate fuel consumption data.

Kindly provide your guidance on how to proceed with updating the ticket accordingly. Thank you for your assistance in resolving this matter.

Dear Tess,

Thank you for your email regarding the change in Sitara to agree with the contract. It was a mistake during flash to obtain pricing information, which was inadvertently included in the original contract. We have updated it accordingly. Please ensure that all relevant parties are updated on this matter so that they can proceed with any necessary actions.

Regarding the new deal number for Chevron Chemical Co., LP, LP (HPLC 04/01 Sales/Buyback): We are now using Sitara to book these volumes as per the new agreement. Please note that the original contract was not used during this process, but should have been created based on the latest version. The new deal number is 001089, which has been updated accordingly.

Should you have any questions or concerns regarding this matter, feel free to reach out to me at (713) 853-6311.

bad news . . . . . the cleburne imbalance is out of control . you might want to start some payback to lonestar . lonestar ' s estimates for the accumulative imbalance at the beginning of may was 140 . 0 due them , now i guess their actuals came in and now at the beginning of may shows 214 . 0 due them . i am waiting to hear back from lisa with lonestar to see why there is such a big discrepancy . through the 16 th , her updated estimates reflect an imbalance of 240 . 0 due them . . . . the plant continues to overpull , our nom to the plant which is not all 45 . 0 due to brazos ' take .
let me know what you want to do .
mark","Regarding the Cleburne imbalance issue, I apologize for the delayed communication. As per your instructions, I'll be reviewing the situation and providing my feedback. In the meantime, please follow these steps to rectify any issues or concerns:

1. Start paying back the imbalance; make sure all necessary adjustments are made to align with your expectations.
2. Collect the necessary information and update the actuals.
3. Collect the required funds from Lonestar, ensuring that the imbalance remains at 140.0.
4. Contact Lisa for clarification on why there is a discrepancy in their estimates.
5. Wait until we receive a response from Lonestar regarding why there is an imbalance in April.

Please note that the plant's overpull is expected to lead to a loss of 45.0 due to Brazos' take. If you require any further assistance or clarification on this matter, feel free to reach out.

Kindly let me know your thoughts on these suggestions so we can address it promptly and effectively. Thank you for your cooperation.

I understand that we will continue to pursue channel/EL Paso/Tenngasco as long as there's a positive outcome for us. While Robert may be an ally and I do not want to unnecessarily irritate him, we must ensure our progress is sustainable and avoid any potential complications.

Regarding the netting of contracts, it appears that we may need to address the Columbia Energy resolution as it has yet to be resolved. I have been in touch with Mary Poorman, but she has some questions regarding the amount of unaccounted funds involved in this matter. Could you please confirm the exact figure, and confirm if we should handle the remaining balance of unaccounted funds as per your suggestion?

Regarding Duke Energy 206, we will proceed with a separate report focusing on the matter of the Duke Energy deal. We have already begun collecting the necessary funds, and we will update you once we have the details.

Regarding the NERC's billing, we will follow up with their current billing status. Please feel free to contact us if you have any questions regarding this matter.

Thank you for bringing this matter to our attention. I have looked into the matter and found that Meter #78033 and #78032 are indeed involved in a deal that is set up under the wrong Sitara number and incorrectly linked with the correct deal. This discrepancy may be due to a miscommunication between Sitara #156387 and Sitara #156383.

To address this issue, please provide the correct Sitara number and a specific deal number for Meter #78033 and Meter #78032 for the 3/00 production forward production. This will help us verify the accuracy of our records. If you have any further questions or need assistance, please feel free to contact me.

we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

Reply: Regarding your query about Enron's capacity to continue its role as agent for Tenaska IV, I have been in touch with Brazos and believe it is essential to discuss this further. Brazos believes that they have been offering a similar service for a while now, and they are currently considering selling the excess fuel at a daily price. This may lead to a higher daily price of 10,000/day for the month of November. However, Brazos believes that the company might still be seeking alternative customers to trade physical gas in Texas, which might lead to a higher daily price for December. We should reach out to them to find out more information on the pricing structure and potential opportunities. Please keep me updated on your availability for discussing this matter. Thank you for your cooperation.

1) since the end of November, ENA has not been able to complete gas trading transactions. We cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in Texas. This is due to the bankruptcy. As a result, we are unable to sell Tenaska's excess fuel. We have contacted Brazos to inquire about alternative options to maintain their agreement. We believe it would be beneficial to explore the possibility of selling their excess fuel through a different company, similar to our current arrangement.

2) Since the end of November, ENA has not been able to complete gas trading transactions. We cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in Texas. This situation is due to the bankruptcy, which is hindering our ability to sell their excess fuel. We have contacted Brazos to discuss options for maintaining their agreement.

3) Since the end of November, ENA has not been able to trade physical gas in Texas. We cannot locate any counterparties to trade physical gas in Texas.

daren ,
as you know , we have experienced some fluctuations at the berryman well for
oct , which in turn affects our volumes at the gulf plains plant . from a
physical standpoint , i think that we are fairly well balanced . my concern is
that we are "" overproduced "" on paper by 76 , 162 dth / mo . i think that we need
to bring the nominations up to balance in sitara at the berryman well and , a
corresponding volume at meters 708 and 6363 , with an offset on strangers to
keep the physical side in line . if my understanding is correct ( and if not ,
please correct me ) this should have a positive impact on our current month
ua 4 .
thank you ,
mary","Dear Mary,

Thank you for bringing up the concerns regarding the Berryman well's current month fluctuations. To address your concern, we are currently experiencing fluctuations at the Berryman well, affecting our volumes at the Gulf Plains plant. From a physical standpoint, we seem to be experiencing overproduction due to 76,162 DTH/MO nominations at the Berryman well, which is causing a discrepancy in our current month's volumes at meters 708 and 6363.

Our primary focus should be on finding a balanced solution for balance in Sitara at the Berryman well and keeping the physical side in line. We should also address the impact of the offset on strangers to maintain a balanced volume on our current month's UA4. If there are any discrepancies or discrepancies in your understanding of the situation, please do not hesitate to contact me directly so we can work together to resolve them.

In the meantime, I suggest addressing these issues in an effective manner to ensure a smooth process for everyone involved. Kindly provide us with any relevant information or specific questions you may have regarding the situation so we can collaborate effectively.

espn will launch a 13 - episode , prime - time series this fall entitled
sidelines , the network ' s second reality - based title under the espn
original
entertainment ( eoe ) banner . sidelines will document the season of a
prominent team as told through the eyes and ears of the less visible ,
less
celebrated people who are involved with the team . the football aggies
of
texas a & m will be the focus of the series ' premiere episodes to begin
october 5 .
"" coach slocum and i made the decision to be a part of this exciting
venture
with espn , "" texas a & m athletics director wally groff said . "" we couldn ' t
be
more thrilled that espn has chosen texas a & m for this series . the
opportunity espn gave us to showcase this wonderful institution and all
of
its tradition and heritage is something we could not pass up . ""
in a "" docu - drama "" style , the various stories that surround the team will
be
explored through the voices and actions of people whose day - to - day lives
are
directly affected by living in the town and / or going to the school .
players
and coaches will also be visible and heard from in a more peripheral
fashion , but will not be the primary focus .
"" this is a good opportunity for texas a & m university and we ' re delighted
espn decided to feature the football program and some of the people
behind
the scenes , "" head coach r . c . slocum said . "" we look forward to working
with
them . ""
the participants will be drawn from a cross section of people who
reflect
every aspect of the university and college station , texas . they will be
students , faculty , media , local storeowners , mothers , fathers and some
of
the high school seniors who aspire to attend the university .
"" each person has a role to play with the team , as well as a personal
story , ""
said mark shapiro , vice president and general manager , espn original
entertainment . "" sidelines will see each person grow in character as the
season progresses - - a kind of ' soap - umentary . ' we ' ll weave the smaller
personal stories together through the bigger story of the progression
and
fate of the team and its season . ""
sidelines : texas a & m storylines
- - this is the 125 th anniversary of the school ' s founding ( 1876 ) .
- - the community is still very much dealing with the 1999 bonfire
collapse
which tragically killed 12 students almost two years ago . a 90 - year
tradition came to a tumultuous end . dealing with the loss and the
emotional
toll it took on faculty members , students and families will be an
important
part of this series . the bonfire will return in 2002 but will take on a
different form than has been tradition .
- - texas a & m , who lost a wild , snowy independence bowl last year in
overtime
to mississippi state 43 - 41 , will play notre dame ( at home ) , texas ,
oklahoma ,
kansas st and colorado next year . a tough schedule will provide for
great
drama .
- - the school invented the phrase "" 12 th man "" and actually owns the
trademark .
one game , the aggies were low on players and had a student suit up and
stand
ready just in case he was needed . ever since , a student is chosen for
every
home game to suit up and play on the kickoff team .
- - billy pickard is in charge of maintaining the facilities . he ' s been at
the
university for 36 years and was the student trainer for bear bryant ' s
a & m
team . he was actually in junction , texas for bryant ' s infamous grueling
summer camp . the story of it was a best - selling book , the junction boys .
- - at midnight on the friday night before every home game , a ""
30 , 000
fans show up each week for this time - honored tradition .
eoe , the newest franchise of espn programming , will develop a
wide - variety
of branded programming outside of the network ' s traditional event and
sports
news genres . using a collection of vehicles - - game shows , documentaries
or
reality - based shows - it ' s espn ' s goal to broaden its audience by
appealing
to younger and casual sports fans . in addition , the company is
exploring
new ways to connect with consumers by applying these projects across all
platforms of the espn family - television , internet , radio

eric bass , texas desk trader , requested the following product described below
be traded on enrononline . this product will not bridge into sitara and will
have to be put in manually .
the reason it will not bridge is due to the fact that it can have multiple
stripes of start & end dates rather than one start & end date . currently ,
enrononline can
only send one start & end date per deal therefore it will fail in the bridge
monitor and will have to be manually entered into sitara & subsequently
cleared out of the monitor .
since these transactions could flow next day , it is imperative that these
transactions get into sitara as soon as possible . please read the full
description below . ( this product looks like a month long deal but excludes
weekends . the "" wkd "" is short for week days . )
we do not anticipate a large volume of these transactions but need to be
prepared to react quickly when they do . for the future , we are looking into
the cost / benefit of enrononline having the capability of sending multiple
dates for these types of products .
if you have any questions , please call me at 3 - 5824

subject : 24 x 5 products
we are rolling out the use of the 24 x 5 nat gas product commencing tomorrow ,
may 24 th .
the product is a month - long physical nat gas product traded off the texas
desk . it will be identified as follows :
us gas phy exxon katy wkd juno 0 usd / mm
this product is different from the usual products traded on the texas desk in
that the product description has an
indicator of wkd , which designates that the product only moves gas on a day
that is a monday , tuesday , wednesday ,
thursday or friday .
these products will not bridge into sitara . risk personnel will need to be
diligent to identify these products based
on the information in the product description to ensure that the products are
entered into sitara correctly ( presumably -
strips of monday - friday trades and the corresponding month - starting days
and / or month - ending days ) .
we understand the potential impact of having to manually input these
transactions and have asked the appropriate
systems personnel to examine the links between eol and sitara and consider
building bridge capability . in the
interim , we anticipate that the trading volume on these products will be low ,
and will ask for higher prioritization of the
bridging in the event that volumes increase .

Dear Aimee,

Thank you for bringing this matter to our attention. I have reviewed the situation regarding deal 34342 and its impact on Sitara, and while it appears to be a term deal expiring on January 1st, we have no direct legal authority to extend it at this time. To ensure proper authorization, could you please provide me with further information on the specific terms and conditions? I will then work towards finding an appropriate solution to this issue.

Reply: Subject: Re: Another Hesco Issue

Charlene,

Regarding the HESCO issue, I would like to discuss it further. As per your request, we should not have scheduled any volume for the 29th to 30th since gas flowed on those days. Since gas did flow, I rolled the last price on deal number 29 to cover those days. This was a standard procedure in the past, and I believe it was done due to the absence of any deal numbers.

In regards to the pricing for 29th and 30th of March 2000, we should not have been involved in any deals at that time. As you mentioned, we should not have entered any volume into our system as it was not required to be finalized. As for the pricing for 29th and 30th of March 2000, it seems to be priced at $2.85.00 per mmbtu instead of $2.85 for those days. If you could kindly confirm the correct price for these two days, it would be greatly appreciated.

Best regards,

in addition any other items for a re - start that you can think of please forward to me .
of course we still have the major hurdle of securing a buyer and once / if we do what do they actually submit a bid to purchase . let ' s be optimistic and hope they are interested in the netco structure that has been laid out . regardless we still need to do all of the tasks listed below to get ready .
thanks - bob

Reply: Thank you for sharing the latest communication regarding netco. It is reassuring to know that things will be moving on a smooth and efficient direction. I appreciate your efforts in gathering information and providing insights into the current status of projects and deadlines. As for the seating plan, I believe it's a good idea to consider it as a starting point, given your initial plan and the current status of the contracts and infrastructure. The new equipment and infrastructure are in place, but it might be helpful to have some data from those areas to help us identify and address any potential issues.

Regarding your requirements for transport capacity, we will discuss this during our meeting today. I'll review the seating plans for the two systems in question: one for the Northwest pipeline (which requires capacity of 20 MW and is currently occupied by a team of 11 personnel) and the other for the South Texas pipeline (which requires capacity of 17 MW). We should also consider the capacity requirements of the North American pipeline (40 MW and is currently occupied by a team of 11 personnel).

Regarding the commercial team, it would be beneficial to have a look at their roles and responsibilities for the new facilities and their needs. We should also work with them to find the best fit with your proposed timeline for their work. We'll review the list of entities for the projects and get back to you with any necessary details.

Regarding your proposed timeline for your trips to various locations, we can discuss these options today and find a suitable schedule that aligns with your requirements. In addition, we can arrange for your return if needed. If any issues arise, please let us know.

Regarding the commercial team's roles, we can discuss this matter today and get back to you with any necessary information. We'll be flexible with scheduling and communication.

Regarding the commercial team's responsibilities, we can discuss it further today and get back to you with any necessary details.

In regards to the remaining days of the commercial teams, you will need to get together with them for a meeting to review the plans and timelines. Once we have these details, we can then discuss the schedules and the need for a finalization or startup list.

Regarding the allocation, I believe it's accurate that the gas on Blue Dolphin should be on Blue Dolphin. However, it seems we are still awaiting the confirmation from Sitara on their deal number (650006). To ensure a smooth communication process, please provide further details about the situation and any potential issues related to this matter.

","Regarding the UA 4 11/00, we have finalized the UA 4 deal with Cleburne since November 2000. Gas accounting has booked 21,309 MMBTU as UA 4 from November, which is related to deal 502861 on the Texas desk. The gas from Williams (Deal 384237) was purchased from Williams and transported to ENA's Transport Contract with Deal 502861. The print screen below shows the deal from Zone Transport to ENA - Texas. I believe we need a deal from Cleburne to Zone Transport to complete the UA 4. To proceed with the process, you can either review the November numbers or provide your feedback on the specific dates you prefer. We will proceed with the process as planned. Thank you for your prompt attention on this matter.

Reply: Regarding meter #980074 bammel HPL D/P to Transco, I have been in communication with Fred regarding the allocation issue. We have been working with him to resolve this issue. Transco informed us that they will not proceed with reallocating volumes due to the statute of limitations (6 months). February had a significant amount not allocated. We need to set up a deal to write these volumes off, as well as ensure a timely resolution of this issue. Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.
